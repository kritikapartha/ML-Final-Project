ABSTRACT
Lattice-based hard problems are a leading candidate for implemen-
tation in future public key cryptographic schemes due to their
conjectured quantum resilience. Lattice-based problems offer cer-
tain advantages over non-lattice-based cryptosystems, such as a
relatively short key length [ 3] and versatility, since lattice cryptosys-
tems can offer both encryption schemes (to securely transmit data
from sender to receiver) and signature schemes (used for a receiver
to verify that information actually originated from the claimed
sender) [ 2]. Notably, they are also the only known class of prob-
lems which give rise to fully homomorphic encryption schemes,
in which computations can be securely performed on encrypted
data [ 1]. Many of the 2017 submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum
Cryptography challenge are based on lattice problems [4].
Some lattice cryptosystems, most notably the ring-LWE [ 7]
scheme proposed in 2013, rely on solving a hard problem over
a subclass of lattices known as ideal lattices. However, it is cur-
rently unknown whether the additional algebraic structure found
in ideal lattices make them less secure for cryptographic purposes,
although it is widely conjectured that the ideal case is as secure as
the general case [1].
In this poster presentation, we give an overview of past attempts
to approach a lattice hard problem known as the shortest vector
problem (SVP) in a class of ideal lattices generated using the cy-
clotomic integers, which is a type of mathematical object known
as a ring. The cyclotomic integers have a lot of algebraic structure,
and some researchers have speculated that this structure could po-
tentially make these lattices less secure [ 6]. The discovery that the
ideal-lattice based cryptosystem Soliloquy is not quantum-secure
[5] has motivated cryptographers to examine the feasibility of using
new types of rings to generate lattices, such as the variant of the
crytosystem NTRU proposed in [ 6]. This poster will include our
preliminary results on the security of the SVP in ideal lattices gen-
erated in a ring which has been previously unstudied and discuss
the practically of using the ring in place of the cyclotomic integers
in some lattice cryptosystems.
