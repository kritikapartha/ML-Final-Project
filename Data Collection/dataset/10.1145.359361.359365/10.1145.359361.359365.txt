Technological and nontechnological value 
orientations are investigated with special attention to 
the complexity of value structures. Computer science 
students, who are closely associated with technology, 
contrast with social science students, who are often 
technologically aloof. This is confirmed by the value 
ratings of 313 students at the University of Minnesota 
in 1972. Computer science majors were found to have 
a more complex value structure than social science 
majors.

Introduction 
Computer technology, only a few years older than 
college students of the seventies, steadily continues to 
penetrate almost every aspect of social life. The insti- 
tutionalization of this technology has had at least two 
major social consequences: disruption of prior value 
orientations and the emergence of an occupational 
sector sometimes called the computer world. This 
investigation deals with these two concerns by measur- 
ing technological values among youth, some of whom 
are being educated for work in the world of computer 
systems.

219 Early in the brief history of the computer, Wiener 
[28] warned about the difficulties of controlling cyber- 
netic technology, but only recently has the social value 
of computerization been widely questioned [6, 15]. 
The literature on advanced technology and human 
values attests to the ideological disruption caused by 
the introduction of computers. For instance, technol- 
ogy is described as threatening individual values such 
as creativity, individuality, and emotional expressive- 
ness [6], detracting from inner subjective experiences 
[14, 24], and being a self-estranging substitute for 
spirituality [9]. Dissatisfaction with this presumed dis- 
junction of humane values and technology can increas- 
ingly be found in both scholarly and popular sources 
[4, 8, 10, 16, 18]. 
Because attention to the value implications of com- 
puter technology is a relatively new development, it is 
not surprising that research on social values has 
avoided the issue of technological values. With the 
single exception of La Porte and Metlay [13], system- 
atic empirical research on values has not explored how 
technology is integrated with basic value orientations. 
This investigation attempts to examine the relationship 
between technological and nontechnological orienta- 
tions and, secondly, compares computer science stu- 
dents, who are closely associated with computer tech- 
nology, with social science students, who are often 
technologically aloof. 
The Computer World at Work 
Differences in technological value orientations be- 
tween computer science and social science students are 
suggested by several sources, especially studies in ca- 
reer development and occupational values. Vernon 
and Allport [27] found that science and engineering 
majors held considerably stronger economic values 
than psychology and humanities majors. Rosenberg 
[22] found science and engineering majors to be less 
"people-oriented" than other college students. Davis 
and associates [5] reported that engineering appears to 
attract those low in emotionality and extroversion. 
Rokeach [21] showed that physical science majors 
rank values such as beauty and comfortable life higher 
than social science majors do. These studies of values 
among college students corroborate Roe's [20] study 
of illustrious scientists; she found that social scientists 
were more concerned about social relationships and 
"people as people" than physical scientists and biolo- 
gists were. With the single exception of Mumford [17], 
no one has yet contrasted computer scientists with 
other occupational groups. In the absence of data, we 
might presume that people in computer-related occu- 
pations have values similar to scientists or engineers. 
Boguslaw's "[3] analysis of people in computer-re- 
lated jobs suggested potentially unique value orienta- 
tions; he characterized computer specialists as "new 
utopians" because they seem to share with previous

spondents were asked to rate each value according to the importance 
he/she places on it. A five point scale was provided with the 
following five labels: 1, unimportant; 2, somewhat important; 3, 
moderately important; 4, very important; and 5, extremely impor- 
tant.

utopians a primary goal of rising above human imper- 
fections. Toward this end early utopians employed 
innovations in social organization; contemporary com- 
puter specialists seek perfection in technology. 
Finally, unique value orientations of computer sci- 
ence students might be anticipated as a consequence 
of actual work experiences. Schneider [24] sees anti- 
social tendencies, social irresponsibility, and preoccu- 
pation with gadgetry resulting from work with com- 
puter technology. These are impressionistic claims with 
no empirical substantiation, but they are points worthy 
of consideration. Occupational experiences have been 
shown to have effects on attitudes such as "stance 
toward change" [11]; thus it is not impossible that 
certain value orientations are affected by the work 
situation of the computer specialist. As noted by 
Wrenn [29], computer automation raises questions 
about central values such as the worth of work, the 
worth of man in the role of work, and the worth of 
man relative to computers. 
Measurement of Value Orientations 
A survey of attitudes toward computerization [1, 
2] was designed to investigate the interrelationship of 
technological values with other values and opinions. 
Sixteen different value items (see Figure 1) were listed, 
and the respondents were asked to rate each on a five- 
point scale from "unimportant" to "extremely impor- 
tant." The selection of the sixteen values was based 
upon the Rokeach [21] list of desirable end states, 
which he called terminal values. These values used by 
Rokeach are presented in Table I in the order of 
descending importance as determined by a nationwide 
sample of adults in 1968. Those values that seemed to 
be the most contemporary and salient, especially 
among college students in the United States, were 
picked from Rokeach's list for our study. Several 
values were added in order to represent technological 
and scientific concerns. Table I. Rank Order and Median Rankings of Terminal Values by

Questionnaires were administered to 313 students 
attending four different classes at the University of 
Minnesota during the spring of 1972. The numerical 
ratings form a matrix in which the rows represent 
students and the columns value ratings. This matrix 
was transformed to create the correlation matrix given 
in Table II. The correlation matrix was then trans- 
formed, via factor analysis, to generate the factor 
coefficients listed in Table II. 
The correlation coefficients showing the strength of 
relationships among values (Table II) differ from a 
comparable analysis by Rokeach [21] in at least two 
important respects: (1) the intercorrelations tend to be 
higher on the average, and (2) more concise, logical 
structures emerge from our factor analysis. These 
differences apparently result from instrumentation dif- 
ferences: Rokeach's procedure consisted of requesting 
rank ordering of values whereas our procedure asked 
for separate importance ratings of each value item. 
The ranking and rating approaches differ when the 
actual item distributions of our student ratings are not 
generally uniform, but there is no way to obtain the 
distributions from Rokeach's study. His results might 
have been different had he used a rating rather than a 
ranking method of data collection. 
Several divergent techniques of factor, cluster, and 
smallest space analysis were applied to the intercorre- 
lation matrix in attempts to find which values could be 
grouped together. They gave generally similar results. 
The "key-cluster" oblique factor technique from the 
BC-TRY system [26] was selected for display (Table 
II and Figure 2) because of the simultaneous reliability 
analysis provided and because of the unique spherical 
display of three-dimensional data (Figure 2). Three 
dominant clusters are identified, although one subset 
(Cluster I) has a low reliability and only a few items 
are included. Figure 2 can best be interpreted by 
imagining a transparent globe with the three dominant 
clusters residing near the surface. Items which do not 
fit spatially with any cluster (e.g. "privacy" and "wis-

221 dom") should be seen as gravitating toward the inner 
center of the globe. These items are identified as 
"nonclustering" owing to low correlation with the 
clusters. Clusters II and III are stable, homogeneous 
variable subsets with fairly high reliability. 
The surprising aspect of these clusters is that in 
content they correspond closely with Charles Reich's 
categories in The Greening of America [19]: Conscious- 
ness I, II, and III. The three dimensions also coincide 
somewhat with other social commentaries on the 
American culture of the past decade [9, 12]. Each of 
the three clusters will in turn be evaluated in terms of 
an associated cultural or subcultural value orientation. 
Cluster I-Protestant-ethic value orientation, This is 
the weakest cluster and is extracted last in the factor 
solutions. It is presented here only because of its 
correspondence to Reich's "Consciousness I" category. 
The influence of Reich upon our terminology derives 
from our accepting his analysis as a useful characteri- 
zation of cultural values in American society during 
the late 1960's. (This fascination with Consciousness 
I, II, and III should not be taken as an endorsement of 
Reich's other claims in a book that was one of the 
most harshly criticized yet widely disseminated books 
of the past five years.) Consciousness I represents the 
values of the Protestant ethic and the rugged individ- 
ualism of the United States during the 19th century. 
This orientation suggests the acquisition of salvation 
and the American dream through hard work and self- 
sacrifice. 
Cluster H-Technology value orientation. Con- 
sciousness II is the dominant consciousness of the 
corporate state and indicates an accepting attitude 
toward industrial and technological commitment. 
Roszak [23] uses an orientation called "objective con- 
sciousness," which emphasizes scientific objectivism 
and its relationship to technological orientations. Such 
cultural descriptions are consistent with the mix of 
Communications March 1978 
of Volume 21 
the ACM Number 3variables in Cluster II. "Technological advance" and 
"mechanization" tend to be closely associated with 
science and economic prosperity. To a certain extent, 
these value orientations are linked to the desire for a 
"comfortable life," but otherwise these values are not 
closely associated with personal concerns and orienta- 
tions. 
Cluster Ill-Humane value orientation. While the 
term "humane" is ambiguous and does not necessarily 
contrast with "technological," it does represent the 
variety of personal, social, and aesthetic values con- 
tained in Cluster III. This subset is also reminiscent of 
Reich's Consciousness III, in which he romantically 
idealizes the new "young" generation's dedication to 
sensual enjoyment, self-discovery, and self-liberation. 
An inward orientation stresses such values as "true 
friendship" and "expressing feelings," while an out- 
ward perspective on the world tends to emphasize 
"freedom," "equality," and "preservation of nature." 
Although the empirical data presented here are 
gathered from only a single time period and the sample 
is scarcely representative of the entire culture, the 
findings are not inconsistent with certain themes in 
current analysis of different forms of popular culture. 
The relationship of technological advancement to other 
values is of particular interest here. That it is associated 
with "science" is not surprising, but its close association 
with "economic prosperity" and "comfortable life" is 
more unexpected. Finding the technological value clus- 
ter largely independent of the humane cluster (r = 
.15) and Protestant-ethic cluster (r = .23) reveals 
support for the hypothesis of cultural disintegration of 
technological values from those of a more personal 
nature. Fig. 3. Mean value importance ratings by major (Minnesota Stu- 
dents, Spring 1972).

Computer Science Versus Social Science Majors 
The sample of 313 students at the University of 
Minnesota was refined to include only students taking 
sociology courses and computer science courses; stu- 
dents majoring in other subject areas were dropped 
from further analysis. The sample was subdivided into 
two groups: 61 students majoring in computer science 
and 157 students majoring in social sciences. The 
average importance ratings assigned to the values by 
these two groups are given in Figure 3. 
A number of values are rated differently by com- 
puter science majors and social science majors. Those 
differences which were statistically different at the .01 
significance level were technological advancement, 
mechanization, scientific knowledge, economic pros- 
perity, and equality. It is especially noteworthy that 
most of these values are technologically oriented. An- 
other important difference between the two groups of 
students can be observed by scanning Figure 3: The 
ratings by the computer science students are dispersed 
across the continuum far more than those by the social 
science students. In order to discover additional structural patterns 
in the intercorrelations of the two groups of students, 
smallest space analysis (SSA) was performed on both 
sets of data. SSA is a nonmetric multidimensional 
scaling method [25]. The objective of this technique is 
to map a set of items into a set of points in a metric 
space in such a way that the items that are similar are 
close together in the space and items that are dissimilar 
are distant from each other in the space. Smallest 
space analysis solutions in two dimensions are pre- 
sented for both subgroups (Figures 4 and 5). Only 
fourteen values are scaled in this analysis because the 
two items (privacy and wisdom) with the lowest inter- 
correlations were dropped in order to improve the 
structure of the resulting solution. (The two items 
which were removed were also two of the nonclustering 
items from the BC-TRY key-cluster analysis.) While 
there are some important similarities between the SSA 
solutions for the two subgroups, some noteworthy 
differences are summarized below: 
(a) Computer science majors show greater differ- 
entiation among almost all values, especially humane 
values. This is demonstrated by the dispersion of mean

ratings in Figure 3 and also by the dispersion of points 
in Figures 4 and 5. The values "expressing feelings" 
and "preservation of nature" illustrate this point. The 
average ratings of these two values are close together 
for the social science majors but spread two or three 
times farther apart for the computer science majors 
(Figure 3). Rather than perceiving these values as 
about equally important, the computer science majors 
differentiate them, rating the "preservation of nature" 
higher. A similar pattern is evident in comparing the 
two groups in terms of the value structures generated 
by the smallest space analysis. Figure 4 shows how the 
values "expressing feelings" and "preservation of na- 
ture" are clustered together in the humane-value clus- 
ter for social science majors. There is much less cluster- 
ing of these values in Figure 5, where the perceptual 
structure of the computer science majors is portrayed. 
It would seem that the computer science students 
make more distinctions among values. 
(b) Apparently, greater value consensus is found 
among the computer science majors. On most value 
ratings the variances are smaller for the computer 
science majors, suggesting higher agreement. Consen- 
sus is indicated by the standard deviations for each 
value rating. The standard deviations are not listed in 
this report; they were found, however, to be generally 
smaller for the computer science than for the social 
science majors. Thus the data suggest that computer 
science students may have relatively high agreement in 
their values. 
(c) For computer science majors, technological val- 
ues are more centrally located in the dispersion. Com- 
parison of the two space diagrams (Figures 4 and 5) 
suggests this pattern; however, the primary evidence

Coefficient of Alien .ion (K) = .21 
emerges from the factor analysis solutions, where the 
technology factor is found to be the dominant one. 
(d) The spatial dispersion (Figure 5) of the com- 
puter science subgroup suggests a relatively more com- 
plex organization of value orientations. The computer 
science students seem to have less integration in their 
value judgments than the social science students. This 
difference in value integration can be seen by examin- 
ing the patterns in the smallest space analysis in two 
dimensions (Figures 4 and 5). Integration/disintegra- 
tion of value structures is indicated by the degree to 
which a simple/complex solution is obtained in the 
smallest space analysis. The coefficient of alienation K 
is a measure of the imprecision of the fit between the 
model and the data and is thus an indicator of complex- 
ity. In our analysis K is considerably higher for the 
computer science group (K = .10). Less cluster density 
is found in the value orientation of the computer 
science group, in contrast to the fairly distinct value 
clusters of the social science group. 
In the course of this analysis we have discovered 
substantially more complexity in the value structure of 
the computer science group than in the social science 
group. Although the value structure of these students 
is not easily characterizable, it is obvious that the 
structure is not undimensional. The computer science 
students, in particular, despite their susceptibility to 
modes of technological thought, cannot be adequately 
described in terms of simple patterns of value orienta- 
tion. 
Further research is required to identify the sources 
of value complexity among the heterogeneous youth 
of contemporary society. No data are yet available to 
determine the relative roles of factors prior to recruit- 
Communications March 1978 
of Volume 21 
the ACM Number 3ment and socialization experiences. Feldman and New- 
comb's [7] review of research on the impact of college 
experiences suggests that differences in value orienta- 
tions, and perhaps value complexity as well, may be 
due to variations in college experiences. Research 
should be designed to determine if the anticipation of 
becoming a computer scientist and initial occupational 
experiences have an effect on individual values. We 
have found that the youth entering the computer world 
are unique in the way they structure their values. It 
has also become apparent that not only the level but 
the structure and complexity of value orientations 
should be empirically examined in any followup stud- 
ies. 
The Relationship Between Values and Attitudes 
One of the unsolved problems in research on values 
is the precise nature of the relationship between atti- 
tudes and values. The generally accepted distinction is 
that an attitude is specifically directed toward an object 
while a value is a more general orientation transcending 
particular objects and situations. Values are more 
likely to function as criteria by which to formulate and 
evaluate specific situations. Consequently values are 
not only predictive of attitudes but of behavior as well. 
Both attitudes and values are generally measured with 
rating scales in social surveys; so the distinction be- 
tween the two, as well as their relative usefulness, is 
not always obvious or clear. It is possible that an 
attitude, e.g. attitude toward computerization, is 
largely based upon value orientations rather than upon 
such factors as personality traits, social characteristics, 
or specific experiences. 
Research on attitudes toward computers should be 
concerned with values and value measurement. Our 
investigation included a number of computer-related 
attitude measures so as to examine the relationship 
between value orientations and attitude toward com- 
puters. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the best 
method of assessing attitudes toward computerization 
consisted of those questions listed in Table IV. Stu- 
dents responded to these questions using five categories 
ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." 
Reliability analysis attempts to estimate how much 
of the variation in responses is due to transitory influ- 
ences. Two types of estimation were applied: internal 
consistency (Cronbach's Alpha test) and stability or 
consistency over time (test-retest correlation). The 
former measures chancelike variation among items, 
and the latter measures variation, some of which may 
be random, through time. The fourteen items yielded 
an internal consistency value of .86, which is well 
within the bounds of conventional acceptability. The 
time consistency for the sum of the fourteen items was 
.70, which is fairly high considering the times of testing 
were eight weeks apart. The sum of responses to all Table III. Computerization Attitude Scale Items.

1. Computers are dehumanizing people and turning them into 
machines. 
2. Computerization tends to dehumanize people. 
3. People are becoming too dependent on computers. 
4. We would all be better off if punched cards were not used so 
often to represent us. 
5. Organizations seem to use computers and punched cards to 
avoid dealing with people and their problems. 
6. Computers are preventing the average citizen from having direct 
contact with the government and private industry. 
7. People lose a sense of responsibility when they "rely" on a 
computer. 
fourteen questions was used as the attitude score for 
each student. Value orientation scores were also con- 
structed for each of the three value clusters by summing 
across the relevant items. 
The results of a standard stepwise regression analy- 
sis predicting attitude toward computerization from 
the three value orientations as well as a set of social 
background variables are summarized in Table IV. The 
normalized regression coefficients demonstrate that 
value cluster II (technological) and value cluster III 
(humane) are significant predictors of attitudes toward 
computerization. Furthermore, for several of the back- 
ground variables, the regression coefficients were con- 
siderably lower than the simple or zero-order correla- 
tions with attitude toward computerization. This was 
especially true of the variable "major" (computer 
science versus social science), which indicates that the 
difference in attitude between these two groups is 
partly a result of a more basic difference in value 
orientation. The computer science students tended to 
be more favorable toward computerization than the 
social science students, which may be largely a conse- 
quence of their placing greater value upon technologi- 
cal advancement. While there are many remaining 
questions in this investigation of the relationship be- 
tween attitudes and values, our finding does suggest 
how future research might give attention to this phe- 
nomenon. 
Conclusion 
This investigation reveals alternate modes of value 
orientation and adjustment to technology. In addition 
we have found that students undergoing socialization 
into the computer world already possess uniquely com-

plex modes of value orientation. The computer science 
students apparently do not accept the simple dichotomy 
between technology and the individual, although it 
seems social science students do. 
Our data on computer science majors suggest that 
they are "utopian" in the sense that they place person- 
centered, humane values nearly as highly as social 
science majors do. They also place other values, espe- 
cially technologically relevant values, higher. This pat- 
tern supports the conjecture that the computer science 
students tend to be more idealistic; they seem to be 
considerably more optimistic about the possibility of 
satisfying numerous values simultaneously. This ten- 
dency may account for the highly complex scheme of 
values found among these students. 14. Marcuse, H. One-Dimensional Man. Routledge & Kegan Paul,
