ABSTRACT
The goal of the session is to help attendees who are committed to
diversity and inclusion learn to talk about different dimensions of
identity (e.g., race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, etc.). The landscape
of terms is always changing and we want SIGCSE attendees to
feel more comfortable using current language to talk about issues
related to diversity and inclusion. This special session will include
eight short videos, individual reflection, and a Q&A with presenters.
This is an expansion of a special session held at the NCWIT Summit
in 2019; it was well received and we hope to offer it to the larger
SIGCSE audience. The format also lends itself to attendees shar-
ing the videos and discussions with their colleagues after SIGCSE,
which are available at http://ncwit.org/intersectionality-videos.

1 SUMMARY, AUDIENCE, AND TIMING
The objective of the session is to help SIGCSE attendees learn to
talk about different dimensions of identity. The intended audience
is SIGCSE attendees who are interested in expanding their under-
standing about dimensions of their students’ identities and current
terminology. While the facilitators will be there to answer ques-
tions, the core content of the session can be shared with colleagues
because the information is presented through short videos.
Eight videos, each approximately three minutes, are divided
into four topics (See Section 4). After playing the videos in each

https://doi.org/10.1145/3408877.3432581topic (with closed captioning for accessibility), attendees will have
3 minutes for individual, silent reflection. During this time, our
slides will show a countdown timer and questions that encourage
attendees to reflect on and apply the information from the videos.
During this time, attendees can also post questions and comments
in a text channel to presenters. After these 3 minutes, presenters
will address attendee question and comments on each section for
approximately 7 minutes. The session will end with 10 minutes
of discussion of how to share these resources with colleagues and
addressing any remaining questions or concerns.
The flexible structure of a special session provides the opportu-
nity to include videos and silent reflection. Section 2 identifies the
topics covered, the reflection questions, and additional resources
for learning. This format is particularly well-suited for use in a
video conferencing format.
2 OUTLINE OF THE SESSION TOPICS
2.1 Gender-identity, Sex, Sexual Orientation &
Pronouns
Videos [5, 9] and resources [2, 11, 19] address the learning goals:
•Define and distinguish current terminology.
•Explain the value of respecting people’s identities/privacy.
After the videos attendees will view the following questions:
(1)Define (a) gender identity, (b) gender expression, (c) biologi-
cal sex, (d) sexual orientation, and (e) pronouns.
(2)How might a student feel if a teacher uses their birth name
rather than preferred name or are misgendered?
(3)A student named Cameron uses the pronouns “they/them/their.”
Use their pronouns in a sentence and then only their name,
which works when you don’t know someone’s pronouns.
(4) How can binary gender categories cause harm?
2.2 Race & Intersectionality
Videos [ 12,20] & resources [ 1,8,13,18] address the learning goals:
•The idea of race was invented and does not represent a
biological reality, but does shape how people are treated.

1234•Intersectionality describes the ways in which people’s expe-
riences differ based upon the interactions of multiple forms
of bias such as racism and sexism.
After the videos attendees will view the following questions:
(1) Describe ways in which your identity is intersectional.
(2)Although gender and race are socially constructed and de-
fined, why should you look for patterns for women of color
or other intersections of marginalized identities?
(3)Have you noticed a tendency to avoid race labels and instead
refer to individuals or groups as “diverse” or “ethnic” or
“minority”? Why might this be problematic?
2.3 Privilege
Videos [14, 17] and resources [3, 10] address the learning goals:
•Privilege is an unearned, unasked for advantage.
•When a dimension of someone’s identity is privileged, it
often is not conscious because it is assumed to be the norm.
After the video, attendees will view the following questions:
(1) Why might a White person identify as having a race?
(2)How might recognizing dimensions of your privilege be
important even if you have experienced hardship?
2.4 Bias
Videos [7, 15, 21] & resources [4, 6, 16] address the learning goals:
•Implicit bias is informed by stereotypes and acts uncon-
sciously even when we think we are not biased.
•We can take proactive steps to mitigate our bias.
After the videos attendees will view the following questions:
(1)Explain to your partner the importance of the dental hygiene
paradigm of bias rather than the tonsils paradigm of bias?
(2)What might you say to thank a student for telling you that
your statements or actions have been biased or hurtful?
(3)What assumptions might we make based upon someone’s
pronouns or skin color? How can we counteract this?
