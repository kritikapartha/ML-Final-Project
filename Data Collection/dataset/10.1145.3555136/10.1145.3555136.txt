Sexual exploration is a natural part of adolescent development; yet, unmediated internet access has enabled
teens to engage in a wider variety ofpotentially riskier sexual interactions than previous generations , from
normatively appropriate sexual interactions to sexually abusive situations. Teenshave turned to online
peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about theseexperiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts
(#=45¬ï955) made by adolescents (ages 13‚Äì17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine
their online sexual risk experiences . By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of
* =0¬î90)identifiedpoststhatcontainedteendisclosuresaboutonlinesexualriskexperiencesandclassified
the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e.,
stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience ,
2)detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions , and
3)further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in
the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners;
unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family
member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk
experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù versus ‚Äúrisky‚Äù. Our work provides a deeper
understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being,
risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.

1 INTRODUCTION
A significant portion of adolescents‚Äô social growth and development has been mediated through
the extensive usage of social media platforms [ 77].For instance, easy access to these online
platforms has enabled adolescents to express and explore their sexuality in new ways [85,96].
‚ÄúSexting,‚Äù or engaging in sexual conversations, sharing flirtatious comments, or sending sexual
self-images online has been a topic of research inquiry for over a decade [61,92].More recent
literature [ 28,31,74] has broadened the definition of sexting to also include sending, receiving,
and forwarding any kind of sexual messages (e.g., text, images, videos) across various technology-
mediatedplatforms(e.g.,textmessages,email,socialmedia) .Althoughadolescentsexualexploration
isconsidereddevelopmentallynormal[ 82],publicdiscussionsofadolescents‚Äôonlinesexualbehavior
have focused primarily on its possible risks, harm, and detrimental consequences. Research on
adolescent sexting has focused on examining its association with adverse consequences ,such as
substance use, risky sexual behaviors, coercion, anxiety, depression, and suicide [ 4,15,20,110].
However, other researchers have found no association between adolescents‚Äô sexting and negative
consequences [ 51,72]. Therefore, a broader perspective of adolescents‚Äô online sexual experiences
should be explored by going beyond treating these experiences as either riskyorsafeand by
contextualizing these online sexual experiences in a nuanced way [75].
The spectrum of online sexual experiences of teens may range from normatively healthy re-
lationship exploration torisky sexual behavior that could lead to negative consequences (e.g.,
pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease), sexual abuse, and‚Äúsextortion,‚Äù which includes ‚Äúthreats
to expose sexual images to coerce victims to provide additional pictures, sex, or other favors‚Äù
[108] and has been identified as a new online threat to youth. Yet, an overly generalized view of
adolescent online sexual experiences and risk can impede prevention efforts, andintervention
plans to protect teens from experiencing adverse life events that could negatively impact them
into adulthood. For instance, the development of machine learning algorithms that predict and
detect online sexually risky behavior, such as child pornography, sexual harassment, predation, or
solicitations [ 13,43,109] may cause unintentional harm, particularly to more vulnerable users, if
these experiences arenot appropriatelycontextualized. This is why organizations like the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) [ 87]havetaken a strong stance that teens who engage in sexting (i.e.,
voluntarily sending an explicit self-image) should not be prosecuted as sex offenders, even though
distribution of child pornography is a federal crime, as this would have lifelong consequences that
are not commensurate with the offense.
Prior research has shown that youths‚Äô online sexual risk experiences vary significantly based on
whethertheinteractionwasconsensual ornon-consensual[ 30,104]andonwhethertherelationship
was between intimate partners orstrangers [ 17,47]. We conducted an in-depth examination of
teens‚Äô (ages 13‚Äì17) disclosures about their online sexual risk experiences to address the following
research questions:
RQ1:Can adolescent online disclosures about their online sexual risk experiences be accurately
identified from their posts? If so, can these posts be further classified by a) level of consent and b)
relationship type?
RQ2:Are there distinguishable differences and/or patterns in adolescent sexual risk experiences
based on level of consent and relationship type?
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.From ‚ÄòFriends with Benefits‚Äô to ‚ÄòSextortion:‚Äô
A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:3
RQ3:What unique linguistic patterns (i.e., topics) in the posts lend more nuanced insight into
the differing contexts in which these sexual risk experiences unfold?
To answer these research questions, we licensed a dataset from an online peer-support platform
that is mainly used by youth and young adults to seek support fromand provide support to others.
To answer RQ1, machine learning models were trained based on manually labeled data ( #=8¬ï271)
to first identify disclosures of online sexual risk experiences from other types of posts, then to
classify these posts based on the expressed level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual
abuse) and by relationship type (i.e., stranger, friend/dating, family). The final classifiers achieved
an average Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.90. The classifiers were then used to machine
label a larger corpus of posts ( #=45¬ï955) for further analysis.
For RQ2, between-group differences were examined through a Chi-square ( j2) analysis of the
larger dataset. Our analysis revealed that consensual sexting was significantly more likely to occur
between teens and their friends/dating partners, while non-consensual sexting was significantly
more likely to occur with strangers. When sexting involved a family member, it was more likely to
be indicative of sexual abuse. We then leveraged topic modeling and our own qualitative insights
to delve into RQ3. Overall, we found that there were beneficial reasons for teens to engage in
consensual sexting, such as when exploring their sexuality, seeking romantic partners within the
LGBTQ+ community, or in long-distance relationships. However, in other cases, even consensual
online sexual experiences wereoften due to underlying mental health conditions. Teens engaged
in sexting with strangers, for instance, as a coping mechanism for depression or to seek love and
acceptance; similarly, teens were pressured to engage in sexting to alleviate their friends/dating
partners‚Äô mental health problems, whooftenthreatened self-harm if they did not comply. In some
cases, both consensual and non-consensual sexting led to more severe forms of sexual abuse that
resulted in physical and psychological harm. Our results demonstrate the complexities around
technology-mediated consent, online sexual risks, and how these experiences cannot be studied in
isolation from the mental health and well-being of youth. Our research makes several important
contributions to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the literature of adolescents‚Äô
online safety:
We accurately classified the levels of consent and relationship types within these disclosures
(average AUC=90), demonstrating the importance of the underlying architecture of machine
learning models to achieve accurate classifications.
We uncovered key patterns related to teens‚Äô online sexting behaviors based on the level of
consentandrelationshiptypes,showingthatteens experienced moreconsensualsextingwith
friends/dating partners, non-consensual sexting with strangers, and sexual abuse committed
by family members.
We highlighted the nuances unpacked from teens‚Äô disclosure that went beyond the explicit
consent statement to understand the underlying factors (e.g., mental health issues) that
surround and may undermine consent.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide an overview of previous research on adolescent online safety and
sexual risks, thestate of computational approaches for sexual risk detection, and how our work
complementsthislineofresearch.[2].Thus,theliteratureonadolescents‚Äôonlinesafetyhasprimarily
focused on [104].

2.1 Adolescent Online Safety and Sexual Risk
Adolescence is characterized by risk-taking, experimentation, and limited understanding of the
adverse consequences of potentially risky behaviors [ 2]. Thus, the literature on adolescent online
safety has primarily focused on protecting adolescents from exposure to possible threats [ 105].
As such, research on adolescents‚Äô sexting behaviors is often motivated by the potential risks,
adverse consequences, and legal considerations [ 4,6,29,54,103].For instance, legal scholars
have generated a substantial body of work on laws to criminalize and appropriately respond to
technology-facilitated sexual offenses [ 24,48,49]. These works highlight how civil and criminal
laws have fallen behind on how to respond effectively to online sexual risks, especially those
involving minors, due to the lack of comprehensive understanding of these risks and the harms
associated with them [ 24,49]. Henry and Powell [ 49] defined a subset of commonly encountered
sexual risk behavior that is facilitated by technology. This included the non-consensual distribution
of sexual content, unwanted sexual solicitations, sextortion, and ‚Äúrape by proxy,‚Äù which is a new
trend where an individual solicits a third-party online to commit a sexual crime on a victim. While
these works make great strides in addressing the potential legal consequences, complexities, and
pitfalls of online sexual risk behavior, they are not always grounded in the first-person online
experiences of youth.
Empiricalstudiesdirectlyinvolvingyouthtendtohighlighttheadverseoutcomesassociatedwith
the online sexual risk behavior of minors. For example, Gamez et al. [ 37] found that adolescents
who have experienced sexting in the past will most likely experience a significant increase in the
number of sexual solicitations over the next year. Galvete et al. [ 18] found that adolescents who
were solicited by adults online engaged in more sexting experiences with others. Other studies
have highlighted the negative outcomes and life consequences of online sexual risk behaviors,
including mental health problems, teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and drug and
alcohol abuse [ 4,15,20,95]. Medrano et al. [ 66] also reported that online sexting behaviors have a
significant association with increased cyber-victimization, which resulted in mental health issues
related to depression and suicidal ideation. Another major line of research suggests thatonline
sexual experiences with adult strangers (i.e., sexual predators) can entail the most serious adverse
consequences, such as sexual solicitations [ 71,100,101]. Overall, these studies emphasize the
heightened risk associated with teens engaging in sexual behaviors online, which in turn highlight s
the need for effective risk mitigation and prevention strategies to protect youth online.
Acknowledging the potential consequences of adolescent sexting can help in mitigating risks;
however, it also paints an incomplete picture by treating most online sexual behavior of youth as
problematic or deviant. Yet, scholars [ 75,84] have recently started to push back on the intense
‚Äúmoral panic‚Äù around the technology-mediated risks posed to youth, suggesting we take a more
child- and teen-centric approach to studying risk-related online phenomena. For instance, Gewirtz-
Meydan et al. [ 39] surveyed youth to understand their perceptions and attitudes around sexting
and found that adolescents who engaged in sexting did not view it as a crime. Instead, Razi
et al. [85] recently found that teens viewed sexting as a normal progression of their romantic
relationships and garnered some benefit from these experiences. Similarly, Choi et al.‚Äôs [ 22] four-
year longitudinal study found that adolescents‚Äô engagement in online sexual behavior steadily
increased from adolescence into emerging adulthood, suggesting developmental progress over time.
As such, researchers have begun to advocate for the importance of acknowledging both positive
and negative developmental outcomes associated with adolescent sexting with a focus on educating
adolescents about safe sexting practices [ 74,80]. Therefore, addressing the perception gap between
overly risk-focused research and adolescents‚Äô personal experiences regarding their online sexual

encounters necessitates a deeper and more nuanced examination and teen-centered understanding
of these experiences.
2.2 Computational Approaches to Detecting Sexual Risks
In recent years, researchers have started to apply deep learning methodologies, such as Convolu-
tional Neural Network (CNN), to detect sexual risks in social media data [ 23,55,56,62,109];with
promising results. For instance, Chowdhury et al. [ 23] applied various deep learning models to
identify disclosures of sexual harassment using public Twitter posts and achieved 96% accuracy.
Hassan et al. [ 46] proposed data-driven supervised learning for identifying sexual violence reports
from the #MeToo movement on social media to examine these types of disclosures more deeply.
These researchers detected whether the posts included sexual violence , distinguished among dif-
ferent types of sexual violence (e.g., Unwanted Sexual Contact, Non-contact Unwanted Sexual
Experiences, Sexual Violence, Completed or Attempted Forced Penetration, Alcohol or Drug Facili-
tated Penetration, Forced Acts, Alcohol or Drug Facilitated Acts), and identified the relationship
betweenthe perpetrator andthe victim(s)(e.g.,Intimate Partner,FamilyMember,Personin Position
of Power/Authority/Trust, Friend or Acquaintance, Stranger) [ 46].Their best F1 score reported
for detecting sexual violence was 80%, with 58% for specific type of sexual violence and 62% for
the perpetrator-victim relationship. A recommendation from this study was to address the lower
accuracy of the classifiers by adopting a deep learning approach.
We build upon and address the limitations of these related works in several ways. First, prior
workwasnotfocusedspecificallyondetectingtheonlinesexualriskdisclosuresofadolescents,who
are a particularly vulnerable class of internet users. In contrast, our work focuses specifically on
teens (ages 13‚Äì17) and on their first-hand onlinesexual risk experiences. Second, we contextualized
our classifiers based on the level of consent expressed in the post (i.e., consensual sexting, non-
consensualsexting,sexualabuse)andrelationshiptype(i.e.,Stranger,Friend/DatingPartner,Family),
obtaining accuracy levels that were better or on par with past studies. Third, we move beyond the
risk classification problem to further unpack statistical differences and qualitative insights from
the digital trace data of teens who soughtadviceorsupport regarding their online sexual risk
experiences. In doing so, we take a more holistic approach to detecting and understanding the
myriad online sexual risk experiences encountered by modern-day teens.
3 METHODS
Our main goal was to unpack adolescents‚Äô online sexual riskexperiences by deeply analyzing their
posts disclosing these situations. To accomplish this goal, we first describe our dataset, scoping
process, and data annotations for ground truth. Then, we describe how we addressed each of our
research questions.
3.1 Dataset
3.1.1An Online Peer Support Platform for Youth and Young Adults .We licensed a dataset from
an online peer support platform that caters to youth and young adult users , who are interested in
discussing topics related to mental health, relationships, sexuality, religion, and more. We chose to
anonymize the name of this platform to protect the identities of the youth whose data we analyzed.
On this platform, youth post pseudonymously (i.e., by username rather than by real name [ 63]),
and we took care to remove any personally identifiable information from quotations shared in this
paper.The dataset originally contained around five million posts and 15 million comments made by
approximately 400,000 users. The posts‚Äô time frame ranged from 2011 to 2017. Approximately 70%
of the platform users were between the ages of 15‚Äì24. Although the dataset did not contain any
information about nationality, most platform users were English speakers. Our Institutional Review
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:6 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
Board (IRB) deemed this study to be ‚Äònon-human subjects‚Äô research because we analyzed a dataset
without personally identifiable information (e.g., usernames). For the protection of users‚Äô privacy,
the quotes included in this paper were paraphrased or slightly altered (e.g., adding abbreviations
and introducing false details that do not affectthe context [ 16]) to make sure the quotes could not
be linked to specific people.
3.1.2DataScopingandRelevancyCoding .The dataset was scoped and annotated as part of our
prior published work (anonymized for review). Therefore, we will provide the necessary details
needed below for review and reference our prior work upon publication. In order to scale down
the five million posts into a practical number of posts for data annotation, we took the following
steps.First, we filtered the posts based on user-labeled categories provided by the platform when a
user created a new post. The relevant categories included sex, relationships, friends, family, ask
girls, and ask guys. We determined the most relevant categories based on a manual inspection of
the data. Second, we filtered the posts to include onlyusers who were between the ages of 13 and
17 based on their profile information that was provided with the dataset. The resulting dataset
contained 54,226 posts. Third, we filtered the posts to include those that contained both sexual
and technology-related words. To do this, we created a lexicon of popular sexual jargon used by
adolescents [ 94]combined with technology-oriented terms, such as the names of popular social
media platforms. These search terms were also supplemented by additional keywords extracted
after amanual review of five thousands posts. The keywords used were grouped conceptually into
‚Äúsocial media platform,‚Äù ‚Äúonline,‚Äù and ‚Äúsexual‚Äù categories and listed in Table 1. Then, a SQL query
was written based on these keywords to filter the 54,226 posts, resulting in a set of 8,271 posts
made by 6,351 adolescents about their online sexual risk experiences.

Next, we reviewed the 8,271 posts for relevancy. Posts were deemed relevant if they described
some kind of sexual experience that involved an online component. Posts were divided among five

annotators, and each post was reviewed by two coders. The raters showed a substantial agreement
(Cohen‚Äôs kappa = 0.71). A consensus was formed among all five coders to resolve conflicts. The
resulting dataset contained 4,180 (51%) disclosures about online sexual experiences and 4,091 (49%)
posts that did not meet this criterion . These labels (online sexual disclosure/not online sexual
disclosure) were then used as ground truth labels for addressing RQ1.
3.1.3 Ground Truth Annotations. The 4,180 relevant posts disclosing teens‚Äô online sexual risk
experiences were further annotated based on 1) level of consent and 2)therelationship type between
theteenandtheindividualinwhichtheydescribedsharingthesexualexperience.Twoindependent
annotators coded each post and reached substantial (Cohen‚Äôs kappa > 0.70) to complete (1.00)
agreement. We describe these dimensions and codes in more detail below.
Levels of Consent. While consent is a complex concept when dealing with minors, who are by
legal definition under the age of consent [ 60], our work acknowledges the importance of taking
into account the agency and first-person perspective of teens when disclosing their personal sexual
experiences. Further, prior work on adolescent online risk behavior has shown that teens‚Äô online
risk experiences vary significantly based on whether they considered themselves victims, willing
participants, or initiators of a given risk experience [ 106,107]. Through a grounded analysis of the
data, we derived the following distinct levels of consent:
Consensual Sexting: Posts where teens explicitly stated that they pursued or willingly partici-
pated in an online sexual exchange with another person.
Non-consensual Sexting: Posts where teens explicitly stated that the online sexual exchange
was unwanted, unwelcomed, or unsolicited.
Sexual Abuse: Posts that disclosed non-consensual online sexual exchanges evolved into a
physical sexual interaction in real life (e.g., statutory rape).
Consent Status Unknown :Posts where the level of consent was not expressly specified or
discussed in an interpretable way, or posts where consent as a concept was unknown .
Asnotedabove,weusedthisdefinitionofconsent,whereteenshadtoexplicitlystateawillingness
to engage in a sexual exchange for it to be coded as ‚Äòconsensual.‚Äô Our rationale for this decision
was that interpreting implied consent from a single post is problematic from both an ethical and
legal standpoint [ 7]. Thus, posts had to be clear that the sexting behavior was either initiated by
the teen or done willingly (without undue coercion). For example:
‚ÄúAnyone sext? I‚Äôve been sexting for a year and it‚Äôs like an addiction to flirt with people
online once I‚Äôm feeling bored‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14 years old.
Regarding non-consensual sexting, we found that teens were often fairly direct abouttheir lack
of consent, which aided in coding these instances:
‚ÄúWhy do guys just send nudes? All I said was hey and then you sent me a dick pic without
asking! What makes you think I would want that? I‚Äôm not a hoe, and sorry I‚Äôm not gonna
entertain you‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 16 years old.
Sexual abuse involved non-consensual sexting that resulted in an offline sexual encounter with
the teen. While we acknowledge that all non-consensual sexting can be viewed as a form of sexual
abuse [24], these situations were different in that they were physically harmful to youth and would
potentially rise to the level of mandated child abuse reporting [ 67]; therefore, a separate category
for these types of sexual risk experiences was warranted. As an example, many teens disclosed
their personal stories about being victims of rape:
‚ÄúMy relationship with my boyfriend started when i was 13. after about a week I sent him
videos‚Ä¶ I was happy to make him feel good. After that he started to touch me in class‚Ä¶
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:8 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
Later on he raped me. I didnt want it happening again. He told me I was worthless girl
with only a body and a slut. I became extremely suicidal I took pills and I tried to cut ‚Äù ‚Äì
Female 14 years old.
We coded a total of 1,136 posts as consensual sexting, 705 as non-consensual sexting, 243 as
sexual abuse, and 2,043 as not applicable.
Relationship Types. Relationship type is another important aspect of teens‚Äô online sexual experi-
ences, as the assessment of the sexual riskiness attached to these experiences may vary based on
the relationship between youth and with whom they sext [ 85,97]. The relationships between teens
and others involved in the online sexual riskexperience disclosure posts were:
Strangers: Posts that describe experiences between an adolescent and a stranger.
Dating Partners: Posts that describe experiences between an adolescent and a dating partner
in a romantic relationship.
Friends: Posts that describe experiences between an adolescent and a friend or acquaintance.
Family Members: Posts that describe experiences between an adolescent and a family member.
Not Applicable: Posts that were ambiguous as to the relationship between the teen and the
individual or did not specify.
Quotations presented in section 4.4 are conceptually grouped by the relationship types described
in the posts to illustrate examples of how we coded based on relationship type. While these
categories were relatively straightforward to code for, during our preliminary analysis of the data
set we noticed enough similar patterns between the ‚ÄúDating‚Äù and ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù categories that it was
often difficult to ascertain the differences between the two. Further examination of the literature
revealed that past studies also found the boundary between friendship and romantic relationships
was often blurred in adolescence [ 25,26]. For instance, as in the following quotation, teens often
talked about romantic feelings towards someone described as a close friend.
‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve liked this guy for 6 years and he‚Äôs like my best friend and we love each other so
much but like as friends. He‚Äôs 14. And he just asked me to send pictures to him. Like naked.
And he sent me a pic of his d**k and it kinda turned me on. I kinda sent him a pic back.
What does that mean?‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14 years old.
Further, when conducting an initial analysis for RQ2, the j2test of independence found no
significant differences between the ‚ÄòDating‚Äô and ‚ÄòFriend‚Äô categories [ j2(3 5=4,#=2084¬∫=
210¬î36¬ï ?=0¬î87].Forthesereasons,we decided tocombinethetwointooneFriend/Datingcategory
for the analysis presented in this paper. Therefore, we coded 2,084 disclosures about online sexual
experiences that occurred with strangers, 841 within friend/dating relationships, and 80 with family
members.Thesecodeswereusedtotrainarelationshipsclassifiermodel(aspartofRQ1)tomachine
label a larger dataset for further analysis in RQs 2 & 3, while the posts that were coded as not
applicable were treated as missing values for the machine learning algorithms.
3.2Classifying Online Sexual Risk Disclosure Posts
In the following sections, we explain our data pre-processing and the supervised machine learning
approach for answering RQ1.
3.2.1 DataPre-processing andModels. Multiple steps were performed to pre-process the datasets
before running the models. First, any post with one or two words was removed since context
cannot be extracted from two words. Then, the posts were converted to all lowercase. A preliminary
exploration was done for the classification framework with stopwords and stemming, and we
found no noticeable differences in the accuracy of the classifiers. Therefore, we opted to keep the
stopwords and the original form of the words to preserve how adolescents express themselves. The

A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:9
next step was using a Python library called Keras Tokenizer to convert the posts into tokens that
can be fed to the models. Both interpretable models (SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic regression)
and deep learning models were preliminarily explored, and the initial results yielded from training
the models showed that deep learning models significantly outperformed the interpretable models;
therefore, we opted to move forward using deep learning models. The first step was to train and
optimize the classification models using the manually labeled dataset. In this work, we applied
deep learning models for predicting the following:
Online Sexual Risk Disclosures/Not Online Sexual Risk Disclosures : Binary classification models
used to predict whether or not a post contained an online sexual risk disclosure .
Level of Consent : Multi-class classification models wereused to predict the types of sexualrisk
experiences based on the levels of consent, which were consensual sexting, non-consensual
sexting, and sexual abuse.
Relationship Types : Multi-class classification models were used to predict the relationship
types, which included stranger, friend/dating, and family.
Deep learning models are known to decrease the false rates for text classification [ 9]. Based
on this fact, theLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and theConvolutional Neural Network
(CNN)modelhave been widely applied for text classification. Recently, CNN and LSTM have
been used for Natural Language Processing of small text classification [ 59,81]. Therefore, the
performance of CNN and LSTM across the three text classification tasks was used, explored, and
compared in this study. A 5-fold cross-validation was conducted along with a random search to
tune the hyperparameters for each model. In each fold, 80% of the data was used for training (out
of this 80% of the data, 10% was used as the validation set) and 20% of the data was used for testing.
The next section will discuss in more detail the evaluation matrices we applied to compare the
models‚Äô performance.
3.2.2 Evaluation. Since we applied the 5-fold cross validation, the average accuracy of the models,
the standard deviation of the accuracy, the class-specific precision and recall, the F1-measure, and
the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were used to evaluate our
models using the test sets. The accuracy and F1 scores provide general insight intothe performance
of the models; therefore, only AUC was analyzed in this study since it can provide more detailed
insights. We report the performance metrics of our classifiers in section 4.1.
3.2.3 MachineLabeling. Aftertrainingandevaluatingthemodelsbasedonthemanuallyannotated
ground truth data, the trained classifiers with the best accuracy performances were then used
to machine label the rest of the dataset beyond the manually annotated data. We labeled the
entire dataset ( #=45¬ï955) based on the classifiers for online sexual disclosures/not online sexual
disclosures, levels of consent, and relationship types, which identified a total of ( #=25¬ï808) posts
that contained an online sexual risk disclosure made by teens. Machine labeling the entire dataset
increased our power to detect significant differences for the j2tests in RQ2, and the larger number
of posts gave us the ability to detect more nuanced topics (RQ3) and better understand adolescents‚Äô
online sexual disclosures across the dimensions of levels of consent and the relationship types.
3.3Examining Between-Group Differences
To examine whether there were differences between the threetypes of sexual risk experiences and
the three relationship types (RQ2), we performed a j2test of independence, which are between-
group (rather than within-group) tests applied when there are two or more nominal variables, each
with two or more possible values [ 91]. The standardized residuals are calculated by dividing the
product of subtracting expected from observed values by the square root of the expected value as
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:10 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
an estimate of the raw residual‚Äôs standard deviation [ 91]. The standardized residuals were used in
this study to show the significant differences between the relationship type and the types of sexual
risk experiences. The j2test was conducted for the combined dataset ( #=27¬ï892) comprising the
manually annotated and machine labeled posts.
3.4Topic Modeling Approach
For RQ3, we leveraged topic modeling [ 41] to further unpack teens‚Äô online sexual disclosures across
the differing levels of consent and relationship types. Topic modeling, which has become a popular
approach in the HCI literature [ 42], is a useful unsupervised approach to identify topics in teens‚Äô
online sexual disclosures based on a textual analysis of these documents. Similar to prior works
[5,40], we complemented the topics extracted by the algorithms with our own qualitative interpre-
tations of the data. To do this, we analyzed the top 15 words contributing to the topic and then read
through the top 50 ranked posts (with the highest probability for each topic) through an iterative
and inductive qualitative content analysis [ 50] approach to further interpret contextual details
contained within the disclosures. We semantically labeled our topics to assign high level descriptors
to them based on our understanding of the top 15 keywords and the qualitative interpretation of
the top 50 posts.
For creating the topics, the posts were cleaned based on the following steps: 1) removing stop-
words that did not add any semantic value, 2) stemming, 3) tokenizing. After the normalization
step, the topic model was iteratively run and kept removing words that were not specific enough or
meaningful to the analysis, such as ‚Äúthe,‚Äù ‚Äúand,‚Äù ‚Äúor,‚Äù and common pronouns . We then proceeded to
run the model on the rest of categories. We reported the average coherence score for each number
of topics to identify the number of topics that would provide succinct cohesion for a particular
category of posts as shown in Table 3.
Two different topic modeling approaches were experimented with for this study: 1) Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 12] and 2) Dirichlet Mixture Model (DMM), which is specifically
designed for overcoming the sparse and high-dimensional problem of clustering short texts [ 111].
To choose the best one, we experimented with the two selected approaches by applying them across
categories with different numbers of posts: Stranger and Consensual Sexting, Friend/Dating and
Consensual Sexting, and Family and Sexual Abuse. To evaluate the quality of the yielded topics, we
used coherence score, which measures the degree of semantic similarity between the top keywords
of the topic [ 69]. We ran the two models with different starting numbers of topics (from 2 to 15) to
compare the performance of these models based on the average coherence scores. LDA performed
poorly compared to DMM across the selected categories, especially the category of family and
sexualabuse,whichhadthesmallestnumberofposts(comparingwiththethreeselectedcategories).
The best average coherence score for LDA was for the stranger and consensual sexting category
(the category with the largest number of posts), but this was less than DMM (a larger coherence
score means the topics are more coherent). Overall, the DMM showed the best average coherence
scores(avg.coherence: -79.39) and yielded more semantically interpretable topics in comparison
with the LDA model (avg.coherence: -98.02) as shown in Table 2. Therefore, we proceeded with the
DMM algorithm. For the rest of the categories, we followed the same procedure by running the
DMM algorithm with different numbers of topics (from 2 to 15) to determine the best number of
topics for that category based on the best average coherence score as listed in Table 3.
For each topic, we then conducted qualitative analysis to gain further insights. We did this by
first analyzing the top 15 most probable keywords for a given topic, then the first author did a
qualitative reading to analyze the top 50 representative posts with the highest probability for each
topic. We used this qualitative understanding of the posts and top keywords to answer RQ3. Section
4.4presents the topic models for the dimensions that yielded strong statistical significance in our

4 RESULTS
In this section, we beginby answering RQ1 and demonstrating how CNN outperformed LSTM
for the three classifiers we built for online sexual disclosures, levels of consent, and relationship
types. Then, we present the significant different patterns of associations between the levels of
consent and relationship types to answer RQ2. Finally, we explore the different topics yielded from
the significant associations basedon the between group analysis to unpack the different levels of
consent and relationship types .
4.1 Identifying Online Sexual Posts (RQ1)
The first step to evaluate the overall accuracy performance of the two deep learning models was
calculating the baseline accuracy, which was 51% for the online sexual disclosures /not online
sexualdisclosures classifier, 36% for levels of consent classifier, and 37% for the relationship types
classifier. Table 4reports the accuracy metrics for the three classifiers; it clearly shows that the
overall performance is better than the baseline accuracy for the three classifiers. For the online
sexual posts classifier, the CNN model performed better than LSTM ( * =0¬î93) in identifying
online sexual posts (refer to Figure 1 for ROC curve of online sexual classifier and toTable4). For
class-specific performances, we observed that CNN yielded a higher precision and recall results for
both classes than LSTM, which confirms the accurate predictions of CNN for each class. The online

The CNN also outperformed LSTM ( * =0¬î84) in predicting types of levels of consent (consen-
sual sexting, non-consensual sexting, sexual abuse) as shown in Table 4.Figure 1 shows the ROC
curve of the levels of consent classifier. Out of the 25,808 online sexual disclosures , we obtained
60% ( #=16¬ï616) as consensual sexting, 28% ( #=7¬ï933) as non-consensual sexting, and 12%
(#=3343) as sexual abuse.

analysis for RQ2 and RQ3 will proceed with a combined dataset of the manual lyannotated and the
machine labeled posts ( #=27¬ï892).Figure 2 (A)shows the distribution of the combined dataset
across the types of levels of consent and relationship types .

4.2Characteristics of the Combined Dataset (Machine and Manually Labeled)
The 27,892 relevant online sexual disclosures were written by teens who were between 13 and 17
years old, with an average age of 15 years old (at the time of posting). Fifteen-year-old teenagers
were represented the largest percentage of posts (27%), followed by users who were 16 (20%), 14
(19%), 17 (18%), and 13 (16%). Most of the posts were written by female users (78%), followed by
male users (12%) and non-binary or unspecified gender users (10%). These teens had been active in
the platform for an average of 7.5 months from the date they first posted. Based on the teens‚Äô posts,
36% mentioned using other social media platforms, such as Kik (39%), Skype (15%), Snapchat (12%),
Facebook (12%), Instagram (9%), a peer support platform (8%), Tumblr (3%), and Omegle (2%).
4.3 Sexual RiskExperiences Significantly Differ Based on Level of Consent and
Relationship Type (RQ2)
Aj2test indicated a significant association between relationship type and levels of consent [j2
(3 5=4,#=27¬ï892¬∫=3357 ¬î4¬ï ?¬ü0¬î001, Cramer‚Äôs +=0¬î245]. Post hoc testing revealed
all three relationship types were significantly different from each other in terms of the level of
consent.Specifically,after ?-valueswereadjustedusingBonferronicorrection,thereweresignificant
differencesbetweenstrangerandfriend/dating( ?¬ü0¬î001),betweenstrangerandfamily( ?¬ü0¬î001),
and between friends/dating and family ( ?¬ü0¬î001). As illustrated in Figure 2 , when comparing
proportions of level of consent disclosures for each relationship type , for consensual sexting,
the friend/dating category had the highest relative proportion (i.e., 77% of experiences involving
friend/dating relationships were consensual sexting), followed by stranger (53%) and family (29%).
For non-consensual sexting, stranger had the highest relative proportion (36% of stranger-related
experiences were non-consensual sexting), followed by family (33%) and friend/dating (14%). For
sexual abuse, the family category had the highest relative proportion (39% of adolescents‚Äô online
sexual experiences with family were sexual abuse), stranger (10%) and friend/dating (9%).

between the levels of consent and relationship types.
Next, we used the standardized residuals to more closely examine associations between each
relationship type and levels of consent . Each pairwise comparison showed a significant association
(shown in Figure 2, all adjusted ?-values ¬ü0¬î001using Bonferroni correction). First, for experiences
involving strangers, there was a strong negative association between strangers and consensual
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:14 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
sexting and a strong positive association between strangers and non-consensual sexting. These
diverging associations suggest that when teens post about sexting with strangers, discussions
are more likely to involve non-consensual interactions. In contrast, for experiences involving
friends/dating partners, we observed the opposite pattern for consensual and non-consensual
sexting. Specifically, there was a strong positive association between friend/dating and consensual
sexting and a strong negative association between friend/dating and non-consensual sexting,
suggesting teens are more likely to have or discuss consensual sexting as a positive experience
with friends or dating partners, while non-consensual sexting was less likely in these relationships.
Both stranger and friend/dating relationships had a relatively weak negative association with
sexual abuse. In contrast, for experiences involving family, there was a strong positive association
between family and sexual abuse, suggesting discussions about family on the peer support platform
studied may be relatively more likely to involve sexual abuse compared to discussions about other
relationships. Additionally, there was a strong negative association between family and consensual
sexting,andaweakpositiveassociationbetweenfamilyandnon-consensualsexting.Thesefindings
provide interesting insights and allow us to unpack these strong associations to examine the nature
of these discussions, which we explore in the following section.
4.4 Unpacking the Online Sexual RiskExperiences of Teens (RQ3)
In this section, we discuss the topic modeling results and qualitative interpretations to unpack the
differences between the levels of consent and relationship types reflected in the posts from the
combined dataset (manually and machine labeled data). The high level descriptor of the resulting
topics along with the top 15 keywords of adolescents‚Äô online sexual disclosures across levels of
consent and relationship types are displayed in Table 5.
4.4.1 Sexting with Strangers. In this section, we unpack the emerged topics from youths‚Äô posts
about their consensual and non-consensual sexting experiences with strangers online.
LGBTQ+ and sexuality ( #=4¬ï443, 51%).The largest percentage of posts regarding consensual
sextingwithstrangerswerepostsmadebyteenswhoidentifiedaspartoftheLesbian,Gay,Bisexual,
Trans-gendered, and other sexual minority (LGBTQ+) community. These adolescents referenced
using online private messaging platforms, predominantly Kik, to connect with and solicit attention
from others within the LGBTQ+ community (e.g., crush, single, attract, flirt, roleplay). For example,
teens often asked to connect with others of a specific sexual orientation to engage in sexual
interactions ranging from simple flirtations to sexual ‚Äòhook-ups.‚Äô A common pattern among these
posts was that these teens often did not specify their gender in their profiles, likely as a way to
signal their non-conformance to gender norms.
‚ÄúI want a flirting buddy .. any takers? bisexual or lesbian .. only girls. send your kik.‚Äù
‚ÄìUnspecified gender 15 years old.
In many cases, these teens were using a platform that meantfor mental health support as a
dating app by posting requests to connect with other teens for sexual interplay . While most of
the posts were from LGBTQ+ teens looking for partners to sext, inother cases, teens sought to
explore their sexual identities through sexual roleplaying with strangers. It was less clear in these
cases whether the teens identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community or simply wanted to explore
different sexual orientations .For example, a 14-year-old (unspecified gender) asked the following
question in a post:
‚Äúanyone wanna do gay roleplay with me on skype? Ill still love you if you dont ‚Åá‚Äù
‚ÄìUnspecified gender 14 years old.
In other cases, teens sought advice from strangers about their sexuality and/or sexual orientation.

‚ÄúBisexual & Gay Males I need your advice- I‚Äôm 16 and questioning my sexuality- I have a
question: Is it strange that I am attracted to: the idea of online sexual relationships with
guys, the idea of giving and receiving oral sex from a guy, BUT I am not okay with other
forms of sex, and I don‚Äôt know how id feel about kissing.‚Äù ‚ÄìUnspecified gender 16 years old.
While seeking out strangers to become sexual partners had the potential to lead to risky sexual
interactions, many of the posts in this topic also illustrated the benefit of being able to connect
with a like-minded community to ask questions, get advice, and explore and exercise their sexual
orientation in a way that was true to their identities.
Mental health motivated sexting ( #=2¬ï962, 34%). The second largest topic for consensual
sexting with strangers contained posts about sexting that on the surface seemed consensual, but
upon further examination appeared to be motivated by underlying mental health conditions, such
as depression (e.g., depress, suicide, cut). These teens appeared to use sexting with strangers as a
way to cope with low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and the desire to be loved, accepted, and
seen (e.g., feel, better, help, attention, need). These posts often were made as a confession with an
undertone of regret and shame, like the following quote from a teen with a mental illness who was
not proud of the nudes she sent.
‚Äú[want to say the truth] I‚Äôve cut and had depression and I‚Äôve sent nudes before I‚Äôm not
proud of. I did send it to people cause I thought it would help me to live more and feel
better ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 15 years old.
These posts often include teens‚Äô experiences with their mental health, including suicidal ideation,
self-harm, and loneliness, combined with a desperate need for relief from these issues. Often, these
teens knew that their sexting behaviors were unhealthy; they just wanted to feel good and be
wanted, similar to the 17-year-old female below who knew she was being used for male pleasure
but admitted that it made her feel wanted.
‚Äú‚Ä¶I know guys just use me to get off but at least someone wants me‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 17 years
old.
Many teens began sexting with strangers as a way to cope with heartbreak or rejection. Then,
they became addicted to the attention and could not stop. Unfortunately, engaging in sexting often
had the opposite effect by making teens feel worse about themselves instead of better. Many of the
posts, like the one below, expressed a deep-seated selfhatred due to these experiences.
‚Äú‚Ä¶ he was all I ever wanted and more but now ‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt even talk to me. I changed so
much over the year. i started sending people nudes ‚Ä¶ but now I‚Äôm addicted and getting on.
you made me a fucking hoe ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a bisexual depressed fucking bean‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14 years
old.
Although these posts were labeled as consensual because teens willingly sought out and engaged
in these sexual interactions, it was clear that these experiences were harmful to them. Later, we
discuss the implications of this finding in terms of the complexities around the concept of consent
when dealing with minors, particularly those who have mental health challenges, as well as the
potential unintended harm of inaccurate risk classifications (i.e., false negatives for identifying
consent) when developing risk mitigation interventions.
Sexting with/as adults ( #=1¬ï306, 15%).The other topic that emerged from consensual sexting
with strangers revolved around the concept of age. Age indicators (e.g., older, age, men) were
often associated with sexting keywords (e.g., sext, flirt) across different social media platforms (e.g.,
snapchat, instagram, account) in these sexual disclosures. Teens discussed various platforms‚Äô age
restriction rules (e.g., talk, restrict, age). In these posts, teens talked about online sexual exchanges
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.From ‚ÄòFriends with Benefits‚Äô to ‚ÄòSextortion:‚Äô
A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:17
with adults oradults pretending to be teens. In some cases, teens pretended to be adults themselves
for the purpose of sexting with strangers (e.g., pretend, lie, creep). In many cases, teens appeared
motivated to disclose about these sexual risk experiences because they felt ‚Äúin over their heads‚Äù
and needed advice on what to do:
‚ÄúAn older female on meetme wants me to sext with her not knowing I‚Äôm a lot younger
then her ‚Ä¶ I had created my account to say I‚Äôm older than what I am though I‚Äôm only 15
and I know meetme has strict rules but I do not know what to do I asked her if she has kik
and of course she said no but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable at all‚Äù ‚ÄìMale 15 years old.
Many teens expressed a preference to interact sexually with older strangers because they treated
them better/different than people who were in their age. In these posts, teens often were attempting
to develop caring relationships with people who were older than them, rather than engage in
sexting for the act itself. In some cases, their feelings were reciprocated, but in other situations,
like the one below, the outcome was unclear:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kid @ school, who‚Äôs considered to be the ‚Äòugly girl.‚Äô I‚Äôve always been attracted to
older men cuz they don‚Äôt see me as ugly. They see me as beautiful, sexy, etc‚Ä¶ I started a

and I hope that he truly cares about me too.‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 16 years old
Overall,thepowerdifferential stemmingfromtheagedifference betweenteensandadultswasfairly
apparent as the youth often expressed uncertainty or concern and askedothers on the platform
how best to proceed , as in the following quote from a 17 years old female who sought an advice
about the age difference between her and someone who was 10 years older than her.
‚ÄúI have very strong feelings towards a guy I know online. We have sexted and such for a
couple months. He‚Äôs 10 years older than me. He says he likes me. Idk the problem is the
age difference. Advice?‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 17 years old
Harassment and sextortion ( #=3¬ï767, 62%).Non-consensual sexting was the most prominent
and statistically significant pattern we observed when teens engaged with strangers. These posts
disclosed risky sexual experiences that occurred on online platforms (e.g., snapchat, internet)
that were threatening and/or aggressively charged (e.g., threaten, blackmail, rape, police). Teens
described how strangers manipulated and tried to control them (e.g., convince, demand) due to
sexual content shared (e.g., pic, screenshot, videoed). Teens expressed fear (e.g., scare) abouthow
to handle these situations and asked others what they should do.
‚ÄúI did something really stupid. I was on a chat site talking to a cute boy when he asked for
a bra pic, which I sent, and like an idiot I told him my town and school. Then, everything
changed he threatens to take my pic and post it to everyone‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14 years old.
As shown above, this type of sextortion often occurred after teens made the mistake of sending
a nude or partially nude photo to someone whose affection they were hoping to attract. In more
severe cases, teens were then coerced to continue engaging in non-consensual sexting forfear that
their past mistakes would be exposed and used against them.
‚ÄúThis guy on omegle and he said if I show my tits he will show his dick so I was like okay
whatever. I wanted to leave but he said that he videoed me doing it and if I don‚Äôt do more
he will post it on the Internet. So I kept doing and I was scared that he would post them.‚Äù
‚ÄìFemale 16 years
Strangers used several strategies to harass teens and force them to interact sexually with them.
Teens‚Äô posts described how strangers blackmailed them by saying they would send pictures or
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:18 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
videos of the teen to people they knew with the intention of embarrassing them or getting them in
trouble. To do this, the strangers also had to obtain personal information from the teen, such as
the names or contact information of their friends or the location of their school and/or home. By
the time the person had this information and made their intentions transparent to the teen, it was
often too late for the teens to protect themselves from this kind of harassment and abuse. They felt
helpless, scared, and ashamed.
Unsolicited Exposure ( #=2170, 38%).The other type of non-consensual sexting with strangers
involved receiving unsolicited explicit imagery (e.g., pic, send, dick, nude, random, me, get) from
random people (e.g., pervert) online (e.g., kik). Teens often expressed negative emotions about
these online sexual risk experiences, including fear and disgust (scare, traumatize, puke). These
unsolicitedmessagesincludednudepicturesandpornographicvideos.Inmanycases,teensreceived
these messages ‚Äòout-of-the-blue‚Äô from strangers they had never talked with before. Because of this,
younger teens, in particular, found these experiences surprising, disturbing, and even traumatizing.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm 13 and someone just sent me nudes I am really traumatised.‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 13 years
Many of the teens said that they blocked the account of the offender, and others also reported
the message and the account to the social media platform. It was rare for these unsolicited sexual
messages to lead to further sexual exchanges because teens felt blindsided and violated as to why a
stranger would expose them to unwanted sexual content in the first place.
Sexual Abuse by Strangers. Sexual abuse by strangers yielded weak statistical association in our
RQ2 analysis and had a low post count overall. This may be because teens who engaged with
others to the point of physical sexual contact no longer considered the other person a stranger. As
such, teens‚Äô sexual abuse disclosures in this category mostly described how teens were raped by a
stranger that they met online. Teens reached out on the peer support platform to garner support
and share their stories to connect with other survivors. As to not trigger the reader, we chose not
to include any quotations that depicted these graphic disclosures of rape.
4.4.2 Sexting with Friends/Dating. In this section, we present teens‚Äô consensual sexting, non-
consensual sexting, and sexual abuse experiences that involved friends/dating partners online.
Sexting within a close relationship ( #=4¬ï314, 59%).Over half of the consensual sexting posts
in this category involved a romantic partner (e.g., boyfriend, friend). Many of these online sex-
ual experiences (e.g, flirt, sext, sexual, pic) occurred due to long-distance relationships (e.g., ldr,
distance) on private messaging platforms (e.g., skype). Unlike sexual disclosures with strangers,
teens described deeper relationships (e.g., trust) and more sexual experiences that evoked positive
emotions (e.g., happy, fun) within this topic.
‚ÄúI just sexted with my boyfriend for the first time and he‚Äôs 14 and I‚Äôm 15 but omg. idk. it
was actually kinda fun‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 15 years old.
In long-distance relationships, particularly when teens first met their partners online, sexting
was often used as a way to set body expectations and ensure mutual physical attraction before
taking the step to meet in person. This meant that sexual exchanges would occur before the two
peoplemetinreallife,whichinsomecasesmadeteensmorevulnerable,butinothersituations ,like
in the post below, made them feel more secure that they were not wasting their time and affection.
‚ÄúWanting to send ldr boyfriend who is visiting for first time soon a pic of me in underwear
but covering boobs so he can really see what my body looks like and if he likes me for
who I am and he‚Äôs not wasting his time you know? I‚Äôm chubby‚Ä¶ I think I may feel more
relieved about it.‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 17 years old.

A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:19
Teens used consensual sexting as a way to build intimacy and strengthen their relationships.
Teens often explained that sexting was a way to make others feel happy or sexually gratified.
Interestingly, these exchanges took place not only between partners in a monogamous dating
partnership. Close friends or ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù also engaged in sexting . However, in these
cases, there was more ambivalence and uncertainty in the posts. Teens often worried if they were
getting their desired outcome, as in the following quote from a teen who did not feel that sending
nudes to his lover made her happy.
‚Äú I feel as though me sending nudes to this girl I love as a best friend would make her
happy and she likes them but I don‚Äôt feel they make her happy.‚Äù ‚ÄìMale 16 years old.
In other cases, sending friends nude pictures backfired when the recipient betrayed the sender‚Äôs
trust by sharing the sexual image with other people without the sender‚Äôs consent.
‚ÄúI sent nudes to my friend. I know it‚Äôs stupid but the compliments were so nice and made
me not hate myself for awhile, I trusted him. But at school he showed half my grade. I am
so embarrassed I cut when I got home and filled the tub with blood. No ones going to look
at me the same. I hate him so much, but I hate myself more.‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 15 years old.
Situations like the one illustrated above poignantly highlight how expressions of a deep sense of
betrayal often were accompanied by disclosures of suicidal ideation and/or self-harm.
Mental health motivated sexting with friends/dating partners ( #=2¬ï997, 41%).Aneedforloveand
acceptancemotivatedteenstoengageinsextingnotonlywithstrangersbutwithfriendsanddating
partners. Disclosures about sexting (e.g., sex, picture) with friends/partners often described mixed
emotions (e.g., better, bad, feel), attention-seeking behavior (e.g., attention, ask), and indicators of
mental health issues (e.g., suicide, bipolar, depress, commit). In contrast to what we observed with
strangers, teens often described engaging in sexting with friends/partners in order to meet the
mental health and self-esteem needs of the other person.
‚ÄúMy boyfriend makes me feel bad every now and then, always asks to see it when we
have cyber sex, when I say soon he now begs and pleads, I like to show in my own time
even though he‚Äôs seen it before ‚Ä¶. When he makes me feel bad he blames it on his bipolar
and promises the next day to be okay ‚Ä¶ What should I do ?‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 16 years old.
If these teens did not want to engage in sexting, they did genuinely want to to help the people
who were close to them and were concerned for their safety and well-being. Teens cited suicidal
ideation, self-harm, and mental illness as reasons why they felt compelled to sext with friends
and/or dating partners.
‚Äúone of my friends came to me saying how he was going to commit suicide ‚Ä¶ then he
started talking about pu$$y and sex. Tonight he started asking for pictures and I felt bad
for saying no and I sext with him‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 15 years old
This topic sheds more light on the pitfalls of sexual consent, as teens agreed to engage in sexting
but did so because they felt guilty and responsible for the mental health and well-being of the
people they cared about.
Peer pressure to sext ( #=843, 64%).Non-consensual sexting disclosures between teens and their
friends and/or dating partners shared the same pressure to make the other person happy but with
less of a perceived threat of the other person harming themselves as a result of saying ‚Äúno.‚Äù In this
topic, teens described sexting (e.g., send, sex, photo) experiences associated with more aggressive
keywords (e.g., pressur, threaten) with their friends/dating partners (e.g., bestfriend, ex, friend). In
most cases, negative emotional keywords appeared in these disclosures (e.g., scare, fault, confuse)
as they were non-consensual and unwanted.

‚Äúmy ex boyfriend threatened to leak my nudes that I sent to him when we were dating
because I refused to send him more after we broke up‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 16 years old.
In these cases, the sexting encounter had the potential to ruin trust relationships as teens often
expressed anger and surprise that their friends would ‚Äú cross-the-line.‚Äù As such, teens vented their
surprise and frustration by describing how that the experience led them to distance themselves
from the other person, who they originally thought could be trusted as a friend.
Feelingbetrayedbytrustedothers( #=579,36%).Manyteenswentbeyonddistancingthemselves
from a friend who tried to engage them in non-consensual sexting to expressing anger, rage, and
a sense of betrayal. High levels of negative emotions appeared in teens‚Äô posts expressing strong
feelings(e.g.,pissed,upset,mad,off,horribl,disturb)abouttheirnon-consensualsextingexperiences
(e.g., send, nude) with their friends/dating partners (e.g., friendship, friend). They described these
experiences in an unequivocally negative light (e.g., stupid, bullshit, horribl, hate). Some teens had
extreme reactions, such as being ‚Äòdone with life‚Äô or hating their situation due to such betrayal from
a trusted other:
‚ÄúWhen you trust your friend, then they ask for nudes. I hate my life!‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 16 years
old.
In these posts, adolescents expressed disappointment that their friends did not have more respect
forthem,whichnegativelyimpactedtheirself-worthandfriendship.Theunsolicitedsexualimagery
sent by friends/dating partners made teens feel shocked and violated.
‚ÄúHELP‚Äº‚Äº A friend of mine just sent me nudes over snapchat, I ignored it the first time.. But
then he does it again so I block him.. He‚Äôs a good friend of mine but I‚Äôm not into this! And
I find it disturbing he would send me something like that.. What should I do‚Åá‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale
14 years old.
Sexual abuse by friends/dating partners .While sexual abuse by friends/dating partners was not
as common (weak significance in RQ2 and low post count), these posts often disclosed stories of
rape by someone the teen knew and/or loved. In many cases, the abuse started with consensual
sexting between the known person and the teen, but then went too far when the person forced the
teen to have physical sex with them.
4.4.3 Sexting with Family Members. While less common than online sexual disclosures with
strangers and friend/dating partners, teens also shared about their sexual experiences with family
members. In this case, most sexual interactions with a family member were considered sexual
abuse, but there were instances of consensual and non-consensual sexting as described below.
Consensual sexting with young family members. Most posts that described a consensual online
sexual risk experience with a family member involved similarly aged (i.e., other youth) relatives
(e.g., cousins, brother) who wanted to sexually experiment with one another in a non-romantic but
sexual way. In many cases, the teens justified the sexual exchange based on their feelings of love or
closeness with the other person and how they were sexually aroused by the experience:
‚ÄúMy bro is currently doing his studies overseas. We chat on skype almost everynight. Last
night, he asked if he could masturbate on cam with me. We are very close to each other
since we were little. i confess, i was really turned on watching him.‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14 years.
However, some teens developed romantic feelings towards family members with whom they
sexted. In these situations, teens often described a situation where they connected with a cousin
online who made them feel loved. Given the familial relationship, these disclosures often were
intermingled with a level of confusion aboutwhether the other person reciprocated their feelings
orwhether a budding romance with a cousin was wrong.

A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:21
‚ÄúI think I am in love with my cousin. He is 2.5 years older than me and we started talking
recently because he popped up on Facebook. We flirt so much and he calls me his baby
girl and his princess and tells me that I‚Äôm beautiful. but I‚Äôm so confused. He‚Äôs also asked
me to toss him off when I see him. Do I love him? Does he love me? ‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 13 years.
As shown in the example above, older cousins often engaged their younger cousins in sexting.
Young teens may have ‚Äúconsented‚Äù to the sexual exchange but were often ambivalent and confused
because of it. Some teens also disclosed about their parents finding out about these relationships
and punishing them by forbidding the relationship and/or revoking their technology privileges.
Sharing stories of past/current abuse ( #=42, 53%).When teens disclosed about non-consensual
onlinesexualriskexperienceswithfamilymembers,itwasmostoftensexualabuse.Teensrecounted
their memories of sexual abuse and rape (e.g., memory, sexual, harass, abuse) committed by an
older family member (e.g., parent, brother, older, dad, father) and described the trauma from these
experiences (e.g., afraid, stupid, disgust). These experiences often happened regularly and mostly
during the night (e.g., again, night). In some cases, other family members were aware of what
happened but failed to protect the teen. In many cases, teens disclosed a repetitive pattern of abuse
that occurred over months or even years.
‚Äúmy older brother sexually harasses me and once i told my parents then he stopped for 2
months and he kept doing it again‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14 years
In most cases, these sexual abuse stories involved an interwoven pattern of online and offline
sexual abuse that unfolded over time. Similar to the case below, teens were often tricked into sexual
exchanges with family members who pretended to be an alternate identity online:
‚Äúmy brother who raped me last summer made a fake facebook account and was messaging
me an i didnt know it was him, and we sexted ‚Ä¶ i had no idea who it was.‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 14
years old.
This type of duplicitous digital sexual abuse was worsened because the family member then has
leverage over the teen to further blackmail them into performing other sexual acts against their
will. Teens in these situations felt trapped as they were scared of getting exposed for their mistake
of sexting in the first place. For this reason, teens often felt like they could not identify their abuser
to get help.
Coping with the aftermath of abuse ( #=376, 47%).Teens used the online peer support platform
not only to disclose their abuse but also try to cope with the aftermath. The top keywords that
appeared in this topic were indicative of abuse (e.g., abuse, touch, molest) by adult family members
(e.g., dad). Mental health indicators associated with these experiences (e.g., anorexia, cut, harm,
stomach, suicide, depress) highlight the negative outcomes of enduring childhood sexual abuse.
‚ÄúMy mother had a new boyfriend. One night, I was sitting on my bed ‚Ä¶ He touched me
in ways I never want to be touched again. He hurt me. He threatened me. I was scared. I
didn‚Äôt tell anyone. ‚Ä¶ I had enough of feeling worthless. I took about 78 pills, thinking it‚Äôd
be enough‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄìFemale 15 years old.
Teens recounted how these experiences personally affected them (e.g., scare, threat), often
mentioning suicidal ideation and self-harm as a response to their abuse. While these experiences
were traumatic for the youth, a silver-lining, perhaps, was that the online peer support platform
gave teens a place where they could disclose, make sense of, seek support for, and hopefully heal
from their abuse. Yet, in many cases, it was unclear from the posts whether the teens were able to
get the help they needed to break out of the cycle of abuse and recover.

5 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the important implications ofour findings. We also present implications
for design that move towards support teens‚Äô healthy and safe sexual development in online spaces.
5.1 Accurately Classifying Sexual Risk Experiences and Relationship Types
For RQ1, our work built upon the body of research that has focused on the automatic identification
of online sexual posts using deep learning models. These types of models started to receive more
attention in the last three years due to their promising accuracy performance on text classification
tasks [21]. CNN was found to outperform other models (either traditional or deep learning), on
identifying predatory behavior patterns, predatory conversations, and sexual harassment [ 33,70,
109]. These works presented less accuracy of CNN binary classifiers (up to 0.86) than the average
accuracy CNN yielded in this study (0.90). While LSTM architecture is designed for capturing
long-term dependency in a sequence of words, CNN focusesmostlyonthe informative and most
useful =-gramsorkeywordsfromthewholeinputtext[ 112].Thepostsinourdatasetareconsidered
short-length, which may have contributed to the higher CNN accuracy performance. Although
CNN yields state-of-the-art results, it is not one of the most applied machine learning algorithms
for detecting sexual risk or its context. Therefore, we recommend using CNN more in sexual risk
detection research to provide more evidence that CNN is an appropriate model for this field.
Understanding the differences between CNN and LSTM can help rationalize their different
performances. One explanation might be explained by the different architectures of these two
models, which illustrate s the importance of understanding the semantics of a sentence, something
key to deciphering the underlying meaning of postings aboutteens‚Äô sexual experiences. Therefore,
CNN was suitable for our dataset since keywords are useful enough to identify the class of each
post. In contrast, LSTM‚Äôs focus on the dependency of words can create noise that make it less useful
for terse, casual language used in social media posts. Additionally, sentence length has an impact
on the results‚Äô accuracy. CNN can take advantage of short sentences while LSTM depend sheavily
on longer sentences [ 112]. Moreover, stories, social media posts, or conversations are among the
most popular examples of the input text types provided for machine learning algorithms to identify
sexual risks in general. All these texts can be considered short in length compared to news articles,
documents, Wikipedia articles, and other forms of longer text found online. Therefore, future sexual
risk detection research could consider examining the performances of these models across the text
length and the classification goals (e.g, identifying risky patterns within text) to choose the best
classifier to be used based on either keywords in sentences (CNN) or the dependency between the
words and/or sentences (LSTM).
5.2Online Sexual Risk Experiences of Teens Vary Based on Relationship
For RQ2, we found statistical significance in teens disclosing proportionally more often about
consensual sexting with friends/dating partners, non-consensual sexting with strangers, and sexual
abuse with family members. There are several key implications from these findings. First, while
prior work has been heavily skewed toward studying teens‚Äô sexting behavior with friends and
dating partners as a form of peer pressure [ 10,45,102], we found that teens were often consenting
participants in these exchanges. This suggests a potential narrative shift in sexual health education
towards treating sexting as a normative and developmentally appropriate part of intimate rela-
tionships that should be done with safety in mind [ 14], rather than viewing these experiences as
deviant or risky sexual behavior that should be restricted and punished. We also urge scholars to
perform longitudinal research to investigate the effect of consensual sexting between friends and
dating partners on teens‚Äô relationships, relationship skills, and future sexual lives over time.
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.From ‚ÄòFriends with Benefits‚Äô to ‚ÄòSextortion:‚Äô
A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:23
While sexting with friends/dating partners as a sexual behavior may not be unhealthy within
teen relationships, from a technical standpoint, the privacy risk remains high due to the persistence,
replicability, and discoverability [ 79] of digitally shared sexual information, including nude imagery
of minors that could be construed as child pornography. As consensual sexting becomes more
prevalent and a common culture amongteens, when unpacking the consensual sexting experiences,
a concern was warranted regarding the subsequent non-consensual distribution of sexual content
that was originally shared consensually between two individuals (known in the literature as
‚Äúrevenge pornography‚Äù [ 89]), which could lead to sextortion and sexual abuse. Therefore, additional
research on how best to facilitate digitally secure sexual exchanges between consenting adolescents
is needed to reduce these types of privacy violations and disentangle privacy risks from sexual risks.
For instance, policymakers and legal authorities should find practical ways to lower the burden for
teens to report non-consensual distribution of their sexual imagery (i.e., nudes) without fear of
legal repercussions for having created and distributed such content. Legal protection holding teens‚Äô
digital rights to sext with other consenting teens and preventing the unauthorized distribution
of this content to others would empower youth to report offenders when unauthorized sharing
occurred, which in turn, would prevent sextortion and even subsequent sexual abuse by taking
away power from their abusers.
In terms of sexting with strangers, a clear pattern emerged where in teens were frustrated
by non-consensual/unsolicited sexual advances from strangers. Our finding contributes to the
developing picture of teens‚Äô sexting experiences with strangers online, suggesting that teens‚Äô
struggles might not be related to their consenting to these experiences; rather, the problem might
liewith online platforms providing easy ways for for strangers to reach out to teens. This finding
supports recent decisions by social media platforms toblock strangers from direct messaging
minors who are not following them [ 52]. Yet, while such design choices might protect many
teens from the potential risks associated with non-consensual sexual interactions with strangers,
such changes may also unintentionally hinder the sexual development of LGBTQ+ youth, as we
found that sexual exchanges with strangers were sometimes a necessary means for these youth to
explore their sexual identity and find like-minded sexual partners. Similar to how prior work has
highlighted how content moderation algorithms have unintentionally silenced the voices of those
in the LGBTQ+ community [ 78], we would not recommend implementing blanket policies (e.g.,
blocking all strangers) that protect heteronormative youth at the expense of youth. Instead, we
advocate for providing all youth safer online communities (e.g., verified by age), where they can
seek social support and healthy romantic partnerships. As consensual sexting creates the need to
raise awareness of the privacy risks involved (e.g., making sure to not show one‚Äôs face in a nude
image [44]),it follows that talking to teens about the potential positive and negative effects of
exploring sexuality with strangers requires more nuanced and trauma-informed practices [ 11].
Importantly, our findings emphasize on how teens leverage online platforms to disclose their
sexual abuse experiences. Consistent with prior literature [ 53], teens in our study often disclosed
that sexual abuse was perpetrated by family members. Furthermore , teens described repeated,
prolonged, and graphic abuse that occurred in both cyberspace and in the physical world due to
a power dynamic they were unable to escape. Consistent with prior research [ 3], our findings
highlight that teens are disclosing their sexual abuse in semi-public virtual spaces, where we
might be able to detect these experiences and intervene. Given that teens often do not report
their sexual abuse to legal authorities due to shame, fear of retribution, or getting in trouble [ 90],
online platforms could be a first line of defense for teens who may be victims of sexual abuse by
delivering just-in-time help resources that either connect them with professionals to report the
abuse or educate them on how to take evidence-based measures to protect themselves from sexual
violence. These touch-points could prevent such abuse from lasting longer and potentially mitigate
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:24 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
the serious long-term impact of extended abuse on teens‚Äô mental health. Future research should
consider using social media trace data to investigate familial sexual abuse in particular, in line with
our findings. These disclosures may provide additional details about the incidents described by the
victims themselves and could help supplement gaps in the sexual abuse literature due to a primary
reliance on small retrospective reports of sexual abuse obtained from clinical or legal samples
[65,83]. Empowered with insights gleaned from these onlinedisclosures, online platforms may
find themselves in a better position to support youthin taking an active role in their protection.
5.3 A Spectrum of Online Risk Experiences Ranging from Healthy to Harmful
Overall, we found that adolescents experienced a wide range of online sexual encounters , from
normatively healthy sexual exploration to sexual abuse. In the sections below, we unpack two
complex, intertwined concepts that emerged as important factors when studying these sexual
experiences: consent and mental health.
The concept of consent, especially for minors, is inherently complicated and laden with potential
misinterpretation, especially when it relates to sexual interactions [ 8]. In our RQ3 results, we
unpacked some nuanced examples where explicit consent was given by the teen in their post but
the emergent topics within this coded data illustrated that consent was undercut by indicators of
mental health problems (e.g., depression, low self-esteem, self-harming behaviors, suicidal ideation).
Inmanycases,teensconsentedtosextwithfriends/datingpartnersduetounderlyingmentalhealth
factors (e.g., threats of self-harm), which raises the question about their ability to give unfettered
andwell-informedconsentfortheconsequencesoftheiractions.Therefore,weurgefuturelegaland
social science research to reconceptualize consent in terms of going beyond the explicit statement
of consent to examine the the underlying factors that surround and may undermine it.
In prior work, unwanted sexting (but not overall sexting frequency) has been associated with
a higher risk of negative mental health outcomes [ 98]. Other studies have found that sexting is
correlated with mental disorders and high-risk behavior [ 73,99]. The assumption is often that
sexting leads to negative mental health outcomes. In our work, however, the topic modeling results
uncovered that mental health concerns often acted as an antecedent that led teens to engage in
sexting as we found teens with mental health issues sought attention by engaging in sexting with
others or acquiesced to a sexting request due to concern for the mental health of someone else. An
important implication of this finding is that online sexual risk prevention and mental health are
intertwined public health issues that must be considered in tandem. While the association between
sexual risk-seeking behavior and mental health problems in offline contexts is well-established
[1,36], less work [ 38] has acknowledged that online sexual risk-seeking behavior may be an
actionable way that some teens have found to cope given their mental health concerns. Therefore,
instead of focusing on restricting teens‚Äô online sexual behavior and/or punishing them for it, we
shouldexpandyouth mental health services so that youth have the support they need to make
healthy sexual decisions both online and offline.
On the other hand, our findings also uncovered some legitimate scenarios where adolescents
engaged in consensual sexting with other teens that was not motivated by mental health concerns
or necessarily harmful to teens. For instance, LGBTQ+ youth use online peer support platforms to
make one-to-one connections for support; yet, their sexual identities are often confounded with the
types of support they seek in online spaces [ 57]. Therefore, as we saw, support and intimacy may
coincide, making such interactions appear more ‚Äúrisky‚Äù to outsiders who do not understand the
challenges youth face when attempting to understand and explore their sexual identities. Similarly,
our analysis uncovered how teens are expanding their dating horizons to foster new relationships
online that they might not have had the opportunity to form in their local circles. Researchers
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.From ‚ÄòFriends with Benefits‚Äô to ‚ÄòSextortion:‚Äô
A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:25
argue that online relationships may benefit youth [85], particularly those who have difficulty
forming romantic relationships, such as those who are on the autism spectrum [64]. Therefore, we
recommend future research take a broader, more nuanced perspective that includes both positive
andnegativeaspectsofonlinesexualexperiencesforadolescents,ratherthanonlyconsideringrisks.
In particular, our work highlights how sexting may be considered a normative behavior within
healthy adolescent relationships but can quickly become problematic when one party believes the
interaction is consensual, while the other party feels pressured into it.
As such, our findings suggest a need to move beyond assessing risks and negative outcomes of
teens‚Äôsexualbehaviorsandworktowardabetterunderstandingofthebenefitsofsexting. Inthecase
ofconsensual sexting with strangers, online anonymity and accessibility [ 93] mightmakeit easier
for teens to explore their sexuality and connect with other teens with the same sexual orientation.
As coming out to families is usually difficult for adolescents [ 32], online platforms provide a space
for teens to discuss these issues with peers. On the other hand, consensual sexting with strangers
carries potential risks. For example, posts in our dataset revealed how online anonymity allowed
teen users to seek out older strangers for sexting, in some cases by presenting themselves as older
than their actual age‚Äîeither to deceive other users or to evade platform age restrictions. This
suggests measures taken by social media platforms to limit access by minors may be insufficient if
they rely solely on self-reported age. In general, it would be helpful to transition the conversation
away from unequivocally viewing all adolescent sexting behavior as negative to identifying the
pathways in which it can be done safely and beneficially. The multifaceted nature of online sexual
riskexperiences should thus be considered in the research and design of social media platforms to
better serve adolescent users.
5.4 Implications for Design
Based on our results, we make the following design-based recommendations for online sexual risk
detection, prevention, and mitigation for teens:
5.4.1Algorithmic Sexual Risk Detection Systems .We recommend that, if automated risk detection
systems are deployed in real-world contexts, they take into account contextual features, such
as levels of consent and relationship types when determining how best to support adolescents
in navigating online sexual risk experiences. For instance, any indication that an online sexual
exchange is non-consensual, regardless of the type of relationship, could immediately nudge a
teen to take protective measures and/or seek help. Evenconsensual sexual experiences between
teens and a stranger and/or family member may also indicate that risk mitigation procedures
are needed . In the case that a sexual exchange is consensual, even among friends and/or dating
partners, but the context indicates mental health problems (e.g, depression, suicide, self-harm),
different risk mitigation strategies (e.g., trauma-informed) may be more appropriate. Further, if
consensual sexting results in non-consensual sharing of sexual imagery, measures could be taken
to prevent unauthorized distribution to third-parties. For instance, Meta recently announced that
their private messaging platforms will be implementing end-to-end encryption and notify users
when recipients of their disappearing messages take screenshots [ 113]. While such privacy features
may help discourage unauthorized sharing of sensitive content, researchers also need to carefully
evaluate whether such features may unintentionally harm vulnerable users who take screenshots
to document their abuse. Finally, if any sexual abuse of a minor is detected online, platforms should
have specific procedures in place to proactively report such situations to the proper authorities for
immediate investigation. Recent legislation makes online platforms culpable forsex trafficking that
occurs on their platforms [ 68]; similarly these platforms should also bear responsibility for sexual
abuse propagated on their sites.
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.411:26 AshwaqAlsoubai et al.
5.4.2Intelligent Defaults for Sexting with Strangers .Based on our findings, we recommend future
research investigate the feasibility and user acceptance of an ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù privacy default, where social
media platforms block strangers from privately contacting minors; however, these platforms should
also give teens the ability to override this default. Further, risk awareness notifications should
be included to inform teens about the potential benefits and risks associated with sexting with
strangers. This design would be more powerful in providing both safety notices and choices [ 88]
for teens to proactively manage their private interactions with strangers, rather than blocking
strangers after receiving unsolicited sext messages .
5.4.3AgeVerificationSystems .Another topic that emerged from our analysis was that of age, both
in terms of teens engaging in sexually risky behavior with adults online and/or posing as adults to
engageinsexualexperienceswithunknowingothers.WhileresearchersintheEuropeanUnion(EU)
have recently advocated for age verification systems [ 76] to ensure that internet users are of age to
legally consent to the terms of use for various online platforms, we extend the recommendation
of age verification as a way to ensure teens are not engaging with or as adults in online sexual
exchanges that could potentially lead to illegal sexual activities involving minors. Such systems
may help protect teens from ‚Äúcatfishing‚Äù attempts from adults posing as teens and protectadults
from mistakenly getting sexually involved with a minor. Further research could focus on building
efficient age verification systems and studying the feasibility of integrating these systems into
online platforms to help implement ethical and personalized restrictions.
5.4.4Designing for Computer-Mediated Consent .We also encourage more scholarship examining
and designing better models for facilitating computer-mediated consent [ 114] by design, rather
than leaving room for ambiguity. For instance, dialogues to determine whether a sexual exchange
is consensual could include lightweight mental health evaluations to raise a teens‚Äô self-awareness
of their underlying motivations to sext. Such self-reflections have been found to be a helpful
approach for helping teens make better-informed decisions in other risk contexts. [ 27]. Consent-
based dialogues could also be embedded in the process of sharing of explicit content. General Data
ProtectionRegulation(GDPR)[ 86]requiresonlineplatformsthatoperateintheEUtogiveusersthe
right to remove their personal data, but thisdoes little to enableteens who share explicit imagery
with others to retroactively withdraw consent . One potential area for future research would be
to explore the use of blockchain technologies [ 34], so that teens (and other internet users) can
protect, manage, and remove their sexually explicit digital trace data from the internet. By creating
intentional models for handling the complexities of computer-mediated consent, researchers and
practitioners can takethe needed strides to prevent online child sexual exploitation.
5.5 Limitations and Future Work
Werecognizesomelimitationsinthiswork.Thepostsusedinthisstudywerewrittenbyadolescents
on a single, albeit large, mental health peer support platform. Therefore, the generalizability of
this study may be limited given the nature of the platform. We likely came across more negatively
sexual experiences and abuse disclosures based on the platform‚Äôs purpose and norms, which may
not be as prevalent on general purpose social media platforms. Future research should take into
account different platforms to verify that our results can be replicated to a more diverse population
of adolescents. Secondly, while we were able to build and train machine learning classifiers and
deeply analyze self-disclosures of online sexual riskexperiences, we did not have the victims‚Äô own
interpretations of these experiences, i.e., how risky they perceived these experiences to bean aspect
that can be valuable in training machine learning-based risk detection models [ 58]. Therefore,
future research should consider adolescents‚Äô perspectives on their disclosures of online sexual risk
experiences by asking them to flag or comment on their own posts. Third, since we trained the
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 411. Publication date: November 2022.From ‚ÄòFriends with Benefits‚Äô to ‚ÄòSextortion:‚Äô
A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents‚Äô Online Sexual Risk Experiences 411:27
models after combining friends and dating partners as one class, the models classified it as one
class for the rest of the dataset. Therefore, we might have lost some qualitative differences between
friends and dating partners that future research can investigate within a large dataset.
Conducting studies ofsensitive data from a vulnerable population is a critical matter within the
social computing and HCI communities [ 19,35]. While the platform‚Äôs terms of service stated that
the posts may be used for research purposes, we took more precautionary measures to protect
youth from potential harm. We made sure to anonymize the data and paraphrase example posts
to prevent them from being publicly searchable or traceable to a specific individual. Privacy and
ethics in the context of this type of research, including the suggested design implications above,
need to be persistent topics of discussion in the years coming.
6 CONCLUSION
Unpacking adolescents‚Äô online sexual experiences by taking contextinto account provides a precise
understanding of these experiences, which also lead to more precise sexual risk prevention and
detection approaches. In this paper, we demonstrated how CNN yielded the best accuracy (Avg.
* =0¬î90)inclassifying types of sexual experiences and relationship types of adolescents
posts about online sexual experiences. Youth tend to have different disclosure patterns about
sexual experiences, describing non-consensual sexting with strangers, consensual sexting with
friends/dating partners, and sexual abuse with family members. Byanalyzing the disclosures in
terms of consent and relationship types, we uncovered nuances that demonstrate the complexity of
consent. Discussions of consent must consider the underlying factors (e.g, mental health) that affect
teens‚Äô decision to engage in sextingwithindifferent relationship s(i.e, strangers, friends/dating
partners, and family members).
