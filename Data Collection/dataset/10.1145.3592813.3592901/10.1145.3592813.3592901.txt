ABSTRACT
Context: Soft biometrics is a field that aids traditional biomet-
rics through attribute identification using descriptors such as hair
type, ethnicity, or gender. When employed to large search sets, al-
lows optimization of the search space, thus increasing performance.
Problem: Ethnicity classification is controversial due to unclear
or stereotypical definitions used for classifying individuals, pro-
ducing incorrect results. While there are many applications that
use face images to ascertain ethnicity, no extensive study has been
done to map these approaches. Solution: A literature survey of the
strategies, data, and results used for ethnicity classification is em-
ployed to understand how the issue is being treated in the literature.
IS Theory: Considering the societal nature of ethnicity, applica-
tions that evaluate ethnicity are subjected to Social Shaping Of The
Technology. Investigating these applications can help identify the
societal influence of those technologies. Methods: We present a
systematic literature review (SLR) to map the algorithms, types,
sources of the data, and results obtained for classifying ethnicity
based on the human face. Summary of Results: Many algorithms
are currently used to ascertain ethnicity from face images. These
algorithms may use information from the whole face or opt to use
partial regions of the face. The strategies may use symbolic data
about the face, like face measurements, or use subsymbolic data.
The classification performance appears to be stagnated. However,
datasets overrepresent White, Black, and Asian subjects, with few
datasets being balanced. Contributions and Impacts in the IS
area: This study offers an up-to-date look at how ethnicity classifi-
cation is done, the data used, and the way society may be shaping
technology.

1 INTRODUCTION
The human face is a major source of information regarding iden-
tity. From it, information such as age, gender, and ethnicity can be
obtained. In the context of soft biometrics, such information can
automatically extracted from human face images using machine
learning methods [ 31,35]. In particular, ethnicity information is
considered controversial due to vague definitions and its implica-
tions in many applications where ethnicity data is used to reduce
the search space or create profile clusters, like video surveillance
systems, image search queries, and social interactions [ 11,23,74].
While significant advances have been made in feature extraction
from face images, it still presents a relevant ethical challenge due
to the possibility of incorrect classification of individuals, causing
social consequences when used on systems that rely on ethnicity
classification [38].
Contemporary literature discusses ethnicity as a social construct.
Grosfoguel [25] discusses how ethnicity is currently seen as the
cultural identity of a group, which is often based on shared ancestry,
language or cultural traditions. At the same time, the term "race" is
seen as a loose categorization based on physical similarities among
human populations [ 25,83]. However, many social initiatives take
into consideration visual attributes of subjects in order to apply
affirmative actions.
Considering that the choice of classifying a person within a
group is affected by the social background of the evaluator, the task
can be considered subjective, specially considering phenomena like
the well-documented "other-race effect" [ 14,47,65]. This choice
may be only consensus among the same group as the labeler and
be considered incorrect in different social contexts [76].
Moreover, it is known that society shapes the concepts of eth-
nicity, and by consequence, technologies and methods involving it,
understanding the capabilities and limitations of these strategies
may allow a deeper understanding of the challenges it may present.
Thus, evaluating this influence is an investigation based on the
theory of Social Shaping of Technology, as proposed in [94].
159SBSI ’23, May 29–June 01, 2023, Maceió, Brazil Nascimento, Santos and Bichara Garcia.
To aid in this task, this study seeks to map how ethnicity is classi-
fied using machine learning algorithms through an SLR, exploring
the types of data used and some socio-technical aspects influencing
the current literature. It aims to list the algorithms used, the type of
data used for classification, the source of the data used for training
the models, and the accuracy of these models.
Besides the introduction, this paper has the following structure:
Section 2 provides the background on automated ethnicity clas-
sification and its socio-cultural involving ethical issues; Section
3 describes the research methods; Section 4 and 5 presents the
results and discussion, respectively; Section 6 presents our final
considerations.
2 BACKGROUND
Humans have tried to classify one another since early history. How-
ever, only in the 18thcentury that the current race categories (i.e.:
White, Asian, Black, Latino and Indian ) became standardized and
widely used [ 45]. The categories were based on attributes such as
hair type, skin color, the shape of the teeth, and skull morphology
to divide humans into groups.
Currently, ethnicity reporting in the scientific literature is en-
couraged to clearly describe how the ethnicity classification was
done (e.g., Self-report, Investigator observed, or Survey-based), em-
phasize the adjectival use over the noun form for (i.e., Black men
vs. Blacks) and specify nonspecific groups instead of simply using
the term "other" [20].
2.1 Machine Learning in Soft Biometrics
As previously mentioned, soft biometrics is a field that concerns
itself with the extraction of ’soft’ attributes that can be summarized
into verbal descriptors. Instead of evaluating that a person has a
height of 1.93m, a soft biometrics application could classify this
person as a ’tall’ person. This information is very useful to aid the
construction and retrieval of metadata that improves query times,
reduces the search space and improve performance [15, 31].
The data sources can be diverse, including face images, body
images, gait footage, clothing, or even imprints such as hand or
fingerprints, which can be used to determine gender, age, and eth-
nicity [ 26,31,61,63]. Given the complexity of the task, a large
assortment of machine learning algorithms make the toolset of soft
biometrics.
Dantcheva et al . [15] surveyed the field, evaluating feature ex-
traction and classification methods used in soft biometrics. They
showed that for extracting features, methods such as Histogram of
Gradients (HOG), pixelwise Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
Local Binary Patterns (LBPs), Gabor Wavelets, and other extractors
were widely used for Age, Gender, and Ethnicity tasks. Meanwhile,
supervised learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines
(SVMs), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDAs), and K-Nearest Neigh-
bours were ubiquitous. By the time the study was published, few
Deep Learning based applications were mapped by the authors.
2.2 Ethnicity classification algorithms from
face images
Ethnicity classification is a subset of soft biometrics. The earliest
documented work on the topic is the application of Random BinaryForests and Decision Trees for ethnicity classification by Gutta et al .
[29]. In the study, the authors evaluated 1009 subjects in grayscale
face images categorized into four ethnicities obtained by consensus
among laboratory staff. This study opened the gates for new re-
search into automated ethnicity classification, with the field seeing
new developments in the use of face images for ethnicity classi-
fication [ 48,75,81]. Hosoi et al . [33] developed an algorithm for
detecting and classifying ethnicity from faces using Gabor wavelets
and eye iris information, evaluating three very distinct groups
(White, Asian and Black subjects) within a very small dataset. Sub-
sequent approaches tried using color information [ 97], texture and
shape information [17], local descriptors [12, 59], and so forth.
In a recent effort to map out the field, Guo et al . [27] surveyed the
use of algorithms for multi-ethnic face feature recognition. They
evaluated three major ethnic groups (White, Black, and Asian) and
a selection of the datasets and algorithms used for ethnic classifica-
tion. Unfortunately, the study was not exhaustive nor systematic.
Nor did the authors dove into the strategies used for classification
and the nature of data used for the task. That means that, since [ 15]
and [ 26], no recent comprehensive study to map the initiatives of
ethnicity classification has been done.
2.3 Ethical concerns regarding the use of
ethnicity information
Affirmative actions are considered one of the most important poli-
cies developed in the post-civil rights era [ 85]. They are employed
in many societies concerning historical aspects related to ethnicity
to mitigate inequity and improve diversity [ 72,93]. To access the
affirmative actions, individuals must claim belonging to a group,
which may be done through self-declaration or consensus. This
poses a challenge as membership criteria may not be well defined
and be exploited by ill-intentioned individuals seeking the benefits
of affirmative actions [ 8,21,99]. Countermeasures, such as veri-
fication committees, may add even more challenges, as without
clearly defined guidelines, subjectivity may influence fair access to
affirmative actions [46].
Williams and Edge [94] point, in the seminal work ’The Social
Shaping of Technology’, that technologies do not exist in a vacuum
and are shaped by the dominant values of society, be it economical,
social or political. Likewise, it implies that technologies used to
classify ethnicity will be influenced by the concepts of ethnicity
within a given social context. In this difficult scenario, soft biomet-
rics applications trained on well-defined ethnic groups may aid the
classification by reducing the influence of evaluator subjectivity
and crystallizing and explaining ethnicity concepts as defined by
different social groups, separated by both geography and time.
3 RESEARCH METHOD
We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) considering
Page et al. [67] and Schoormann et al. [79] guidelines.
We used the PICOC model to aid the search string. We defined the
Population as ’Ethnicity Classification Algorithms’, Intervention
as ’Use of facial images, ” Comparison as ’Type of Algorithm Used,
Type of Data Used, Source of Data Used,’ Outcome as ’Accuracy
and Errors,’ and Content as ’Soft Biometrics Applications.’

From these items, we derived two research questions (RQs) (see
Table 1), placed into two categories based on their focus: (i) the
strategies used, the type of classification done and their results,
which we dubbed Method Centric Questions ; and (ii) the type of data
used, the source of the data and the availability of the data used,
which we dubbed Data Centric Questions .

Table 1: Research questions by group
The search string refinement included fine-tuning the keywords
based on the terms obtained from the described PICOC model.
While testing, we noticed a considerable number of studies related
to "data race detection", which is unrelated to the subject of this
study. Since the term "race" means both a competition based on
speed and a group that share phenotypical traits. Hence, our queries
removed the term “race detection”. The final query string used is:
(RACE OR ETHNICITY OR RACIAL) AND (CLASSIFICATION OR
DETECTION OR IDENTIFICATION OR RECOGNITION) AND (FACE
OR FACIAL) NOT "RACE DETECTION" .
We used the following data sources for referral and query for
articles: ACM Digital Library, IEEE eXplore, Google Scholar, Scopus,
and Science Direct. We applied the search string on the title, abstract,
and keyword fields.
Considering Guo et al . [27] review was published in 2016, we
opted to define the study timeframe starting from there so we
could identify articles showing the current developments in the
field since the last review. Due to this, we included in our ar-
ticle pool articles that met the following criteria: a) The study
specifies the algorithm used; b) The study’s primary goal is race
classification/detection/identification through machine learning;
c) The study uses only facial image data; and d) The study was
written in the last five years. Then, studies that met the follow-
ing criteria were removed from the article pool: a) Race classifica-
tion/detection/identification is a secondary aspect of the study (e.g.
Benchmarking studies) and; b) The study implementation/archi-
tecture was not a paper’s contribution (e.g., Application studies).
The articles were selected by the first author and discussed with
the other authors. Disagreements were resolved by vote. The first
author summarized the results according to the research questions
posed. The authors evaluated the extracted data before the writing
of this review.
4 RESULTS
The use of the query string yielded 815 articles. After removing for
duplicates, the number of articles was reduced to 688. By evaluating
the screening criteria, the final pool of articles to 54, which were
selected for reading by the authors. Fig. 1 summarizes the results ofthe search procedure performed in this study. The data extraction
results may be viewed at zenodo.org/record/7430540.

4.1 Strategies used for ethnicity detection (RQ1)
Two broad categories of strategies are being used to determine
ethnicity from image data based on the feature extraction strategy.
The first category includes articles that classify ethnicity based
on evaluating texture attributes (see [ 24] and [ 71]), manipulations of
color spaces (see [ 54,70]), or the use of facial landmarks to measure
facial attributes (see [ 96]). We dubbed this category as Explicit
Feature Backed Methods (EFBM) because these methods rely on
an explicit representation of the face before evaluating the ethnicity
data. The most common approaches observed were the use of LBPs,
HOG, face landmark measurements, and pixel distribution analysis
(Gray-Level Co-occurrence matrices, Color moments, and others).
Table 2 summarizes the results.

44, 60, 82]
Table 2: Types of feature extraction strategies observed
The latter category presents articles that classify ethnicity based
on extracting features using algorithms that obtain intermediate
representations that are not human-readable, like Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs, see [ 95] and [ 86] ) and other deep archi-
tectures such as Deep Belief Networks. We dubbed this category as
Hidden Feature Backed Methods (HFBM) because no previously
known representation is used to extract the features of the face,
which is hidden from the investigator. The use of transfer learning
in CNNs, derived from pre-trained models such as VGG-16, ResNet,
161SBSI ’23, May 29–June 01, 2023, Maceió, Brazil Nascimento, Santos and Bichara Garcia.
and others, was one of the most used approaches in this category.
Overall, CNNs are ubiquitous in this category.
Regardless of the technique used for feature extraction, many
classification strategies were employed in the studies evaluated (see
Table 3). Among them, ANN-Based methods and SVMs were the
most popular among the studies’ methods, followed by the use of
decision trees or random forests. While most of these strategies
rely on supervised learning methods, Achkar et al . [1] transposed
the data points into a Kendall space and from there grouped the
facial data according to clusters, which were only later referred to
ethnicity, being remarkable as the one of the few studies who opted
for an unsupervised technique.

4.2 Ethnicities evaluated (RQ2)
Most of the studies used labels derived from the traditional classi-
fication of races. Within this framework, the Asian subjects were
represented most, followed by White, Black, and Indian ethnicities.
A remarkable under-representation of Latino/Hispanic and Middle
Eastern groups was observed. The groups "Asian," "White," "Black,"
and "Indian" represents nearly 90% of all categories classified in
studies (see Figure 2).

nicity was present in a study
4.3 Strategies classification performance (RQ3)
There is a direct segue from the previous topics regarding the vary-
ing degrees of success from applying the different feature extractionstrategies. As previously noted, two main families of approaches to
classify ethnicity are divided according to the extraction method
of features. Table 4 show the successes of the approaches using
accuracy as the main method of comparison. Accuracy was chosen
due to being the most frequent metric used in the studies, despite
providing biased results for unbalanced datasets [ 13]. We observed
that most studies (46 out of 51, or 85,19%) preferred reporting ac-
curacy. Other metrics reported were Confusion matrices (29,63%),
F1-Scores (20,37%), and ROC Curves (16,67%).
The studies that employed EFBM obtained better results when
looking at the best-reported accuracy for any given ethnicity and
the mean accuracy. However, the lower boundary is higher in stud-
ies that employ HFBM, which means that even in worse conditions,
HFBM approaches may perform better than EFBM. Overall, the
mean accuracy of the algorithms hovers around 85%.
The average accuracy in studies seems to hover around the 85%
mark, with possible increases coming in the next years as HFBM
methods mature. Individual accuracies, datasets traits and metrics
used by article can be viewed at zenodo.org/record/7430540.

4.4 Type of face information used for ethnicity
detection (RQ4)
Being a major source of information regarding human identity, the
choice of the facial input for ethnicity classification may leverage
or hinder the algorithms’ capabilities to determine a correct ethnic
label for the presented face. We observed 5 types of facial data used
for ascertaining a given subject’s ethnicity. Figure 3 summarizes
the type of data utilized and is further developed in Table 5.

sification.
4.5 Data used to train the models (RQ5)
We identified over 30 different datasets that have been used for
race prediction. Among these articles evaluated, it was common
to see authors using a general-purpose dataset to race prediction
or even using datasets dedicated for facial identification and other
face-based visual tasks. Many studies did not find suitable datasets
available at the time of publication and needed to build a tailored
162Machine-based Stereotypes: How Machine Learning Algorithms Evaluate Ethnicity from Face Data SBSI ’23, May 29–June 01, 2023, Maceió, Brazil
Type of Data What is it Examples
Eye and Iris The use of information exclusive
to the orbital area, such as the
shape of eyes or the distance be-
tween. But also, the color of the
iris, shape, and other relevant in-
formation.[53, 78, 82]
Nose The use of information about the
shape and size of the nose bridge,
nostrils, and tip[50]
Partial face The use of selected parts of the hu-
man face, including, but not lim-
ited to, the region around the eyes
and ears, mouth and eyes, facial
shape, and others.[6,10,19,49,52,64,69–71,
78, 96]
Whole face The use of raw face images, which
may or may not be aligned for the
ethnicity classification. Here are
all studies which do not crop the
face into subareas.[1–5,7,9,16,18,22,24,28,
30,32,34,36,37,39,40,42–
44,51,54–56,60,68,73,77,
80,84,86,87,89–92,95,98]
3D Face The use of 3D representations of
the whole or partial face, which
may or may not be projected onto
a 2D plane afterwards[19, 49, 50, 96]
Table 5: Type of facial information used for classification
dataset. Over 1/3 of the studies compiled their own datasets, which
adds another layer of technical complexity to the already difficult
task of classifying ethnicity from the face due to inconsistency.
Many custom made datasets were made due to the need of tailor
the algorithms to be trained for specific populations in their studies,
like observed in Gao et al . [22] , Jilani et al . [37] , Heng et al . [32]
and Srinivas et al . [84] . In other situations, the need for a custom
dataset was due to the specific data type used, such as in Lv et al .
[50]. Table 6 shows the most often cited datasets observed.
5 DISCUSSION
We evaluated the literature regarding the current state of the use of
machine learning algorithms used for the task of ethnicity classifi-
cation. The results indicate that currently, ethnicity classification
algorithms may be divided into two large groups based on feature
extraction methods: those using EFBM, using data such as mea-
surements, LBPs, or HOG; and those who rely on HFBM to obtain
information using strategies based on deep learning strategies, like
CNNs. While the EFBM has been the basis of ethnicity classification
since the first document study [ 29], we have noticed that studies
using HFBM have been increasing since 2017, surpassing EFBM
studies since 2021.
These strategies find similar comparative success in performance
aspects, as noted, with the field appearing to be currently on a
plateau. Some studies, in both categories, perform exceedingly bet-
ter than the average accuracy observed, like Bagchi et al . [6], Mo-
hammed and Sajjanhar [54], Putriany et al . [70] , Saliha et al . [77] ,
which achieved accuracy results higher than 98% using EFBM ap-
proaches and Fan et al . [19] , Wu et al . [95] , whose results are over
99% using HFBMs. However, we noted that the number of classes
evaluated has a high impact on the classification performance, em-
phasizing the importance of careful classification design and high-
quality inputs over a sheer number of examples in classification
tasks [57, 58].Dataset Number of

Table 6: Most frequently used datasets
Regarding classification metrics, classification accuracy is the
most often reported metric. While better metrics exist, they are
less reported than classification accuracy, specially when studies
compare their approaches to the current state-of-art. This needs
to be taken carefully, as datasets used for ethnicity classification
are often imbalanced, and the use of accuracy may induce wrong
conclusions about the successes of the approaches used.
While most studies focused on utilizing the whole face of individ-
uals for the assessment. We also noted the use of partial information
of the face, like the eye, nose, and iris. These strategies may prove
useful in resource-constrained contexts, as they reduce the amount
of information needed for analysis, but currently share the same
success as the complete face approaches [53, 78].
Considering the source of the data used, a third of the studies
needed to customize or create datasets for their own use, implying
that there may be a scarcity in specialization or availability of cur-
rent datasets. The datasets available currently are often based on
traditional ethnicity categories. However, the existence of many
very specialized datasets (such as in And and Prince [5], Gao et al .
[22], Heng et al . [32] , Jilani et al . [37] , Terada et al . [89] ) suggests
that technologies used for ethnicity classification are being shaped
by their social context, as implied by the Social Shaping of Tech-
nology theory [94].
Regarding the more general-purpose datasets, an overrepresen-
tation of Asian, Caucasian, Black, and Indian groups was evidenced.
Since these categories mirror the categories used since the 18th
century, they may prove not as accurate when evaluating faces
163SBSI ’23, May 29–June 01, 2023, Maceió, Brazil Nascimento, Santos and Bichara Garcia.
from countries with complex ethnic dynamics. In particular, as
observed, middle-eastern and Hispanic-latino groups are widely
underrepresented.
In the case of the middle-eastern representation, two main issues
are important to discuss. First, concepts of middle-eastern ethinicity
are not often discussed in eastern works, which use stereotypical
representations that are rejected by middle-eastern individuals [ 66].
While the group is not very miscegenated due to religious and
political motives [ 62], concepts of middle-eastern ethnicity are
not clear or often present in studies. The opposite is observed for
Latino-Hispanic subjects, whose mixing of races pose challenges in
groups like the "Mestizos" and "Pardos" of Iberoamerica, where the
traditional race boundaries are not as well defined and increase the
challenge of ethnicity classification [88].
These attributes in the current literature highlight the influence
of Social Shaping of Technology. Since the reporting of ethnicity
followed the historical notation, we observed that the majority of
algorithms that classify humans according to ethnicity are shaped
to classify the same classes. Many studies try to focus on their local
ethnical groups (see [ 5,39,41] for some examples), which is an
indicative that systems shaped for localized social contexts are in
demand and may present a better fit than general-purpose models.
Comparing our findings to the works of Dantcheva et al . [15] , a
surge in deep learning methods was observed. While the previous
review had a very comprehensive mapping of ethnicity classifica-
tion algorithms, the large majority of the algorithms reported were
based on traditional machine learning strategies. Meanwhile, we ob-
served an inversion trend, with deep learning methods surpassing
the 51% mark on prevalence in studies.
Regarding limitations, the study only covers a restricted part of
the timespan of ethnicity classification algorithms as it focuses on
the last five years of publication. Another limitation is the focus
on classification performance rather than computing performance.
While some algorithms may have acceptable classification scores,
they may be expensive to train and run on limited resources.
Regarding threats to validity, as mapped by Zhou et al . [100] ,
there is, as mentioned above, the restriction of timespan (to treat
it, we used well-known and wide-range digital libraries in the In-
formation System area), biases in study selection (to minimize
the risk of authors’ interpretation influencing the selection criteria,
the protocol was defined and revised by all authors), and lack of
standardized terminologies (while our search strategy consid-
ered both "ethnicity" and "race," the reporting is not homogeneous
in literature and may risk omission of relevant studies).
The results found in this study reinforce how complex classifying
ethnicity is. As can be seen, the lack of consensus, use of general-
purposed datasets, and imbalance of ethnicities representation in
those datasets make the task very challenging in the context of
automated classification. Due to this, IS using such algorithms may
give wrong results and cause unfairness. However, the silver lining
is that with the resolution of some of the issues presented, better
results may be reached using the strategies presented, allowing
IS to better understand how the concept of ethnicty is defined
across social groups and enabling the development of tools using
of these techniques to mitigate unfairness and detect possible fraud
in affirmative actions.6 CONCLUSIONS
This study evaluated how machine learning algorithms are cur-
rently being used to determine ethnicity from face data. Ethnicity
classification is a complex task subject to both technical and social
aspects, making it an important challenge for application in soft
biometrics. While accuracy seems to be on a plateau, the increase
in HFBM approaches may improve the performance of ethnicity
classification in the upcoming years. Researchers should exercise
caution when utilizing ethnicity classification algorithms due to
the possibility of misclassification due to the overrepresentation
of Asian, White, Black, and Indian ethnicities. Our future works
will evaluate and measure the difference between using general-
purpose algorithms, trained on general-purpose datasets, against
regionalized and contextualized datasets. We intend to understand
the influence of social notions of ethnicity on the classification
accuracy of algorithms in ethnically diverse cultures like Brazil.
