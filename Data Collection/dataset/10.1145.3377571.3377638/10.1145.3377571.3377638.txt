ABSTRACT  
Muslims have unique characters which are closely related to their 
religious background. With the high growth of e-commerce in 
Indonesia, it is important to study Muslim market segments where 
Indonesia itself is a country with the largest Muslim population in 
the World. The progress of the halal financial industry and 
business also triggers the e-commerce development among 
Muslim Millennials. Muslim Millennials will become the main 
market and the largest customer segment In Indonesia since one-
third of its population is dominated by millennials. The aim of this 
research is to develop and test a comprehensive model that 
explains how Muslim Millennials develop loyalty to online 
shopping websites (e-commerce). To test the research model, the 
online survey was distributed to a random sample of highly 
educated Muslim Millennials. The results found that positive 
online experience (ﬂow) is the most important antecedent of e -
loyalty in e-commerce websites for Muslim Millennials. Brand 
equity is also a key precursor of e-loyalty. However, trust is not a 
signiﬁcant precursor of e -loyalty for Muslim Millennials in 
Indonesia.

1. INTRODUC
TION Millennials is a generation terminology that is currently widely 
discussed by many groups in various fields of study. Millennials 
(also known as Generation Y) are a demographic group (cohort) 
after Generation X [1]. Social researchers often classify 
generations born between the 1980s and 2000s as millennials. It 
can be said that the millennial generation is today's young 
generation. Millennials are portrayed as individuals who are self-
centered, technologically literate, environmentally conscious, and 
have a low level of brand loyalty [2]. Millennial likes products 
that fit their personalities. They are creative, confident, and 
connected [3]. Millennial is always connected and connected to 
one another through the latest technology. Maulina and 
Hendriyani (2018) suggested that millennial generation seems to 
be more positive and collaborative [4]. 
Millennial generation is different from its predecessor generation. 
This generation tends to be more adaptable to new technology. 
This generation has values, preferences, and shopping behavior 
that is different from other generations [5]. 25% of the world's 
population is the millennial generation which incidentally lives 
where the internet already exists and is growing rapidly [6] . 
Therefore, they have a strong dependence on technology and the 
internet. Compared to Baby Boomers or older generations, 
millennials can access information from websites, including e-
commerce, 5 times faster [7] [8] [9]. 
On the other hand, Indonesia has a fairly high e-commerce market 
growth rate with an average growth of 17% per year according to 
data released by Frost & Sullivan. As one of the countries with the 
highest population in the world, Indonesia has become a country 
that has had significant e-commerce developments in recent years. 
British research institute, Merchant Machine, released a list of ten 
countries with the fastest growing e-commerce in the world. 
Indonesia leads the ranks of these countries with a growth of 78% 
in 2018 [10]. The number of internet users in Indonesia, which is 
more than 100 million users, is one of the forces driving e-
commerce growth. The average money spent by Indonesians on 
online shopping sites is US $ 228 per person or around Rp. 3.19 
million per person. Around 17.7% of respondents spend their 
money to buy plane tickets and book hotels online. As many as 
11.9% of respondents spend their money on clothing and footwear 
products. The third most popular category is health and beauty 
products chosen by 10% of respondents. Furthermore, the growth Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for

369of smartphone users is also one of the drivers of e-commerce 
development in Indonesia. Indonesia is the largest e-commerce 
market in Southeast Asia. 
According to a study by the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), 
Indonesia had a population of more than 260 million in 2017. 
Meanwhile, if viewed from the number of internet users (mainly 
via smartphones) in 2017 it reached 86.6 million users. This figure 
increased by 17.2 million users compared to 2016 or increased by 
24%. When seen its development in the past 3 years, there has 
always been an increase. Initially only 38.3 million users in 2014, 
then 52.2 million users in 2015 then became 69.4 million users in 
2016, until finally in 2017 amounted to 86.6 million users. In 
terms of religion, the majority of Indonesia's population adheres to 
Islam. Around 87.2% of the total population of Indonesia is 
Muslim [1]. 
Today almost everyone has gadgets like smartphones that are 
equipped with internet access, e-mail, social media and the 
marketplace, thus enabling businesses and consumers to transact 
via smartphones. The ease of accessing the internet increases 
businesses to use the internet as a medium to advance their 
business by offering their products via the internet. This is 
reinforced by data obtained from the Indonesian Internet Service 
Providers Association (APJII) in 2017, where the largest 
percentage of 45.14% of the internet was used to find prices, 
37.82% was used as buying information and the smallest was 
16.83% used to sell online [12]. 
Meanwhile, Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the 
world which makes the majority of millennials in Indonesia are 
Muslims [13]. The progress of the halal financial industry and 
business also triggers the e-commerce development among 
Muslim Millennials. Muslim Millennials will become the main 
market and the largest customer segment in Indonesia since one 
third of its population is dominated by millennials. The aim of this 
research is to develop and test a comprehensive model that 
explains how Muslim Millennials develop loyalty to online 
shopping webstore (e-commerce ). 
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
2.1. Generation Theory and Religious 
Background  
Generational differences in social life are one subject that always 
arises in the development of human resource management. 
Therefore, the concept of generational difference continues to 
develop over time. In sociology, there are 8 groupings based on 
the year of birth. The grouping consists of: 1) Generation of War 
(Classical War, World War I, and World War II), 2) Post World 
War II Generation, 3) Generation of Depression Era, 4) Baby 
Boomer Generation, 5) Generation X, 6) Generation Y, 7) 
Generation Z, 8) Generation Alpha. They are born in different 
environmental conditions and situations, therefore the characters 
they have differ from one another [14]. It does not mean that 
every person born in the same era has the exact same character, 
but there are main and prominent characters that become the 
identity of a society living in a certain era [15] [16]. 
Millennials have a unique attitude towards brands where they live 
in an era where many brands have been in circulation compared to 
the previous generation [17]. Basically, millennial generation has 
a low level of loyalty towards a brand [18] but has a high ability 
to process all forms of information that come from web sites. It 
also applies to muslim millennials. Muslims have a unique character that is closely related to their religious beliefs [19]. 
Religion is a phenomenon with effects at various levels of 
analysis: individual, social, organizational, macroeconomic, 
national and regional [20]. There are many studies on the 
influence of religion in other literature, such as investment and 
business. This paper will emphasize the level of loyalty of Muslim 
millennials towards e-commerce, especially for websites. 
Therefore, this next section will discuss design elements for 
online shopping websites and develop hypotheses about how these 
design elements can trigger flow experiences when shopping 
online. 
2.2. Utilitarian and Hedonic 
One of the most important marketing goals is to get good 
experience and customer loyalty [21]. Furthermore, Gabisch 
(2011) shows that optimal experience on brand websites is a key 
factor in gaining loyalty [22]. Customers experience online flow 
significantly leading to increased loyalty. Flow is a pleasant 
experience that people feel when acting with total involvement 
[23]. 
Basically, customers look for utilitarian benefits and hedonic 
benefits on every e-commerce. Comparing product prices and 
quality is one example of seeking utilitarian benefits, while 
looking for a visually appealing website design because it 
provides enjoyment of online shopping experiences is a range of 
hedonic benefits [24] [25] [26]. This proves that there are 
consumers who are looking for "full experience" [27]. These 
consumers are people who only enjoy the observation process to 
get the utilitarian benefits and hedonic benefits. To attract the 
attention of these consumers, e-commerce websites have to build 
a pleasant online shopping experience. Shopping is not only a 
process of getting goods but also for fun, they feel happy and 
comfortable when shopping. Blakney and Sekely [28] found that 
the level of intrinsic enjoyment of shopping experience influences 
consumer behavior. The pleasure of shopping online is closely 
related to the higher intention to revisit the website [29]. 
Growing flow experience is the goal of the utilitarian and hedonic 
features of a website [30]. Most hedonic site features are not 
directly related to purchases, but rather affect customer 
satisfaction and create flow [31]. Attractive designs, entertaining 
website features, and gamification are the characteristics of the 
hedonic characteristics of the website and can create flow 
experiences. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: 
H1. The greater the hedonic feature of an e-commerce website, 
the greater the positive online experience (flow) 
Choi et al. (2007) found that utilitarian features stimulated a flow 
experience [32]. Flow stimulates web evaluations that benefit 
from utilitarian aspects [33]. Some previous studies also tended to 
support this theory, such as a greater user perception of utilitarian 
features in the online environment in accordance with greater 
opportunities to be achieved flowing. Therefore, the following 
hypothesis is proposed: 
H2. The greater the utilitarian features of e-commerce websites, 
the greater the positive online experience (flow) 
2.3. Online Branding and Flow Experience 
A brand can be defined as a set of tangible and intangible 
attributes designed to create awareness and identity, and to build 
the reputation of a product, service, person, place, or organization. 
Originally, brand equity referred to the asset valuation of a brand 
370for accounting purposes [34]. Brand equity was construed to be 
the asset valuation of a brand [35]. 
Burmann et al. (2009) defined brand equity as present and future 
valorization derived from the internal and external brand-induced 
performance [36]. They further explain, this definition includes 
three major categories: psychological brand equity, behavioral 
brand equity and financial brand equity. The conceptual proximity 
of the first two categories leads to a comprehensive and widely 
accepted term: brand strength. From this perspective, brand 
strength is merely used as a substitute term for either 
psychological brand equity or behavioral brand equity. 
Through involvement in flow experience, the E-Commerce 
environment offers new opportunities to create and maintain 
brand equity [37]. Based on previous research, non-attribute 
product factors are more influential than product and experience 
in a virtual environment positively influences brand equity on its 
own product features. Brand equity can be positively influenced 
by hotel websites that offer opportunities for customers to be 
involved in the flow experience. 
Based on brand equity theory, consumers like to associate 
themselves with products and services with a strong brand [38] . 
Brand equity influences attitudes and behaviors which attracts 
customers for repurchasing the product. Furthermore, brand 
loyalty intention is influenced by brand equity in the service 
industry [39]. Previous research has claimed that brand equity 
directly influences brand loyalty [40] . Recent studies found that 
flow experience influences brand equity in virtual contexts [41] . 
Founded on the aforementioned arguments, it was proposed: 
H3. The greater the hedonic features of the e-commerce website, 
the greater brand equity 
2.4. Trust  
A trustworthy website is very important for the success of the 
business in attracting the attention of customers, if the website is 
not trustworthy then customers will hesitate to use it [42]. In the 
business area, trust is one important factor especially in e-
commerce. In contrast to traditional businesses where customers 
can directly see and inspect goods directly, in online businesses 
customers cannot check directly and only rely on information and 
images available on the website. Uncertainty and risk from online 
shopping can be reduced by the trust that creates security for 
customers [43]. 
Based on research conducted by Roy et al. (2001), an increase in 
ease of use and website utility increases the trust of customers 
[44]. This is also supported by Cyr (2008), he found that the 
utilitarian features of the website have a direct impact on trust [45] . 
The quality of other features related to utilitarian, such as 
navigation and functionality, has a positive impact on trust. 
Therefore, it is proposed: 
H4. The greater the utilitarian features of e-commerce websites, 
the greater the trust in e-commerce websites. 
2.5. Positive Experiences 
A person's positive experience will shape their perception of the 
website. In a virtual context, there is a positive relationship 
between flow experience and brand equity [46]. Park et al. (2008) 
also support this theory by stating that positive emotions when 
using a website are closely related to brand equity [47]. Therefore, 
it is proposed: H5. The greater the positive online experience (stream), the 
greater the brand equity 
In e-commerce websites, flow experience is one indicator of 
customers to consider the use of the website. An unpleasant 
experience when using a website can reduce the level of trust in 
the website. Therefore, flow experience can reduce unwanted 
risks such as reduced level of customer trust [48]. Therefore, it is 
proposed: 
H6. The greater the positive online experience (current), the 
greater the trust in e-commerce websites 
According to Smith and Sivakumar (2004), consumer shopping 
behavior is also influenced by Flow experience [49]. Flow 
experience can increase customer interest in repurchasing and 
visiting websites that they feel comfortable with. Customer loyalty 
can be built by improving the customer experience while 
browsing the website. This shows that the emotional relationship 
that is formed from interactions between customers and the online 
environment can increase loyalty, such as the intention to play 
online games and visit e-commerce [50]. Therefore, it is proposed: 
H7. The greater the positive online experience (current), the 
greater the loyalty to the e-commerce website 
2.6. Website Characteristics, Brand Equity, 
Trust, and Loyalty 
Brand equity is a set of a brand asset, liability linked to a brand 
and give added value to the product which helps customers to 
interpret information about the brand [51]. A brand can be linked 
to a name, symbol, image, personality of the product. Customers 
are more likely to consider having a brand they know than they 
know less. Nam et al. (2011) shows that there is a positive 
relationship between brand equity and loyalty [52]. Therefore, it is 
proposed: 
H8. The greater the brand equity, the greater the loyalty to the e-
commerce website. 
The customer's intention to repurchase or use the services of a 
product is based on their level of trust in the product [53]. If a 
product is judged to be unreliable, customers tend not to use the 
product anymore, this also applies in the case of online shopping. 
In the case of a website, if customers already trust an online 
shopping website then they tend to visit the website again, both to 
make purchases and just to look around [54]. Therefore, it is 
proposed: 
H9. The greater the trust in e-commerce websites, the greater the 
loyalty of e-commerce websites 
The appearance of the website on e-commerce affects the level of 
customer trust [55]. Web site display characteristics such as 
graphic design, layout, color selection, and other display features 
affect customer trust. In a survey conducted by Gregg & Walczak 
(2010) on eBay users [56], there was a positive relationship 
between website quality and loyalty. Therefore, it is proposed: 
H10. The greater the hedonic features of e-commerce websites, 
the greater the trust in e-commerce websites 
Brand equity is a representation of the appearance of a brand. In 
the context of e-commerce websites, brand equity is closely 
related to the utilitarian features inherent in the website [57]. E-
commerce centered on the strength of its website makes utilitarian 
features play an important role in showing the product image to 
customers. Therefore, it is proposed: 
371H11. The greater the utilitarian features of e-commerce websites, 
the greater the brand equity 
3. METHOD 
The type of research used is explanatory with a quantitative 
approach. According to Sugiyono (2016), the explanatory research 
is a research that explains the causal relationship between the 
variables that influence the hypothesis [58]. This research uses 
primary data. Primary data is the result of tabulation of the 
respondents' answers. The data is collected from 129 Muslim 
millennials. Primary data were obtained using a questionnaire 
instrument.  
The questionnaire in this study used closed and open questions . 
Data were analyzed and tested using multivariate Structural 
Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques using the LISREL 8.8 
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) program, which is a 
statistical technique that is able to analyze latent variables, observable variables, and measurement errors directly. SEM is 
able to analyze the relationship between one latent variable with 
another latent variable [59], and also to find out the magnitude of 
measurement errors Wijanto (2008). it can be concluded that SEM 
is a statistical technique that can analyze latent variables and find 
out the magnitude of measurement.

Figure 1. Model SEM T-Values Information. 
 
Based on the table 1, it can be seen that the results of the most 
GOF measurements are good fit. It can be concluded that the GoF 
measurement fit of the measurement model generally is good.  
Based on the processed data from the Hedonic variabel t-value to 
Flow is 3.96. Then the Utilitarian variable t-value is Brand with 
the number 3.41. Then the t-value variable Utilitarian with Trust 
shows 4.18. The Flow variabel t-value to Trust is 2.77. Then the 
Flow variable t-value is E-loyalty with the number 4.67. Then the 
t-value variable Brand with E-loyalty shows 2.77. This shows that 
the t-value > t-table (1.96), meaning that the Hedonic of Flow has 
a significant influence but the Utilitarian to Flow is 1.45 has a not 
significant influence. Then Hedonic variable to Brand is 1.72 and 
Flow variable to Brand is 1.34. From these results indicate an 
insignificant relationship. However, when the Utilitarian variable 
to the Brand has a significant relationship. The hedonic to trust 
variable shows the value of 0.81 which indicates no significant relationship between these variables. Furthermore, the utilitarian 
and flow variables towards trust indicate a significant relationship. 
The flow and brand variables on E-loyalty have a significant 
relationship, but the trust variable on E-loyalty does not have a 
significant relationship because it has a value of 1.15 which is 
below the value of 1.96. 
From the above results, it can be concluded that to create flow on 
the webstore should pay more attention and improve on hedonic 
variables than on utilitarian variables. When viewed from the 
hedonic variable, the webstore provider must improve on how the 
webstore can be pleasing to customers who come to visit the 
webstore, because it can be seen in the picture of the t value above 
that hedonics or fun has a high value of 12.66 compared to other 
indicators when creating hedonic to the customer. This finding is 
in accordance with Bilgihan, et al. (2014), Bilgihan & Bujisic 
(2015), and Loiacono et al. (2002) [60] [61] [62]. 
373In improving the brand on the webstore, it must improve and 
innovate in utilitarian, which must provide benefits and in its use, 
must be easily felt for Muslim millennials. Basically, the 
millennial generation wants easy access and functions that are in 
line with expectations [63]. When seen from the utilitarian 
variables more prominent on accurate indicators with a value of 
12.78, the webstore must further improve and maintain the 
accuracy of the available facilities. 
Creating trust in the webstore according to the results above must 
pay more attention to utilitarian and flow variables in the facilities 
provided. When viewed from the hedonic variable with a value of 
0.81 the trust variable shows no significant relationship. It can be 
concluded to increase the trust of Muslim millennials in the 
webstore it must focus more on utilitarian and flow variables. 
Furthermore, the trust variable does not have a significant 
relationship on the variable E loyalty. It can be seen in the figure 
above with the number 1.15. This is due to the low level of trust 
that millennials have. they are not easy to believe in a product and 
tend to have a low level of loyalty . If to increase E loyalty, the 
webstore must focus more on increasing and more attention to the 
variable flow and brand.

 5. CONCLUSIONS 
From the results of this study, it can be seen that E loyalty of 
millennial Muslim customers on webstore in Indonesia is not only 
from flow, brand and trust, but there are other variables that can 
affect E loyalty, among others, can be from E service quality and 
customer satisfaction. So it can be concluded that there is a 
significant influence between the variable flow and brand to create 
E loyalty to customers, but the trust variable does not have a 
significant effect on customer loyalty. Furthermore, the trust 
variable is not only from the utilitarian and flow variables that can 
influence it, but it can be from the influence of product quality and 
can also be from the brand personality of the seller on the 
webstore. So on the brand variable not only from the utilitarian 
that can influence, but can be in terms of promotion and price on 
the products offered on the webstore. Finally, the flow variable is 
not only from the hedonic factor that has a significant relationship, 
but to create flow can be able to provide fast delivery services and 
guarantee goods to their destination safely. From this research, 
hopefully it can provide an overview and information in 
increasing the number of sales and income for business people, 
especially for business people who use webstore to introduce 
products to customers .
