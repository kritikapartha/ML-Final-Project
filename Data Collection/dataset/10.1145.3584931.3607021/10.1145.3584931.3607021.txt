ABSTRACT
The human-computer interaction community has a long tradition
of conducting research in healthcare settings. We conducted a sys-
tematic review of how race is defined and discussed in healthcare-
focused HCI research. Beginning with an initial set of 514 articles
drawn from two major HCI venues, we applied exclusion criteria
resulting in a data set of 29 articles. We found considerable varia-
tion in definitions of race across articles, with some focusing on
physical appearances, others on sociocultural differences, and still
others not providing any explicit definition of race. This variation
was further reflected in the method used to identify participants
race and the level of specificity used in categorizing participants’
race and ethnicity. Additionally, many articles engagement with
race and racial disparities in minor ways, with some articles propos-
ing racial equity as an avenue for future work without attending
to race in their current investigation. Finally, we found that most
articles studied patients and end users, leaving unexamined the
practices and perspectives of healthcare practitioners and insti-
tutions. We conclude with suggestions advocating greater clarity
and consciousness around race, racism, and racial disparities in
healthcare focused HCI research.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3584931.3607021at the hands of police in the summer of 2020, there has been ongoing
public discussion about systemic racism and its widespread effects.
Healthcare disparities have been a central focus of these discussions.
Racial health disparities are multifaceted; they are the result of
structural and systemic factors including wealth gaps, unequal
access to education and jobs, and personal bias in the healthcare
system; and they have severe consequences for racialized people
including systematically higher rates of preventable illness and
death across health conditions [ 3,7,24]. The increased attention
to racial health disparities in recent public discourse has also been
reflected in scholarship in HCI and CSCW, with studies seeking to
uncover and address sources of bias and racism in healthcare (e.g.,
[12,16,22,28,29]) and raising awareness about racism and critical
race theory in HCI and academic research [20].
Alongside the increased attention to racial health disparities,
researchers have shown that there is a lack of consensus around the
definition of race in medical research [ 27]. The term race can refer
to a variety of things including physical appearance, social category,
ethnic background, ancestry, nationality, and country of origin. A
lack of precision and clarity around the multiple meanings of race
can have serious consequences such as the inability to compare and
synthesize findings across studies, and in HCI, mismatches between
designer intentions and user needs and desires.
Hence, we sought to understand how race is interpreted and dis-
cussed in healthcare-focused scholarship in CSCW and HCI by con-
ducting a systematic literature review. We searched the databases
of two major HCI venues for articles that mentioned race in the
context of healthcare, resulting in 29 articles after removing articles
that did not meet our exclusion criteria. We conducted a thematic
analysis of these articles. We found that definitions of race are
unclear and inconsistent in HCI healthcare research. Further, we
found that many articles fail to substantially engage with race,
racism, and racial disparities, with a few articles referring to race
only in participant demographics and future work. We conclude
with suggestions to foster careful and critical engagement around
racial disparities in HCI healthcare research.
2 RELATED WORK
In shining a light on race as a vital dimension of analysis in HCI,
we stand on the shoulders of many giants. A detailed review of
prior work is outside the scope of this short submission, but we
provide a brief overview to establish the background. Harrington
et al. conducted a systematic review of HCI research on aging
[12]. Based on an examination of 174 articles, they found that HCI
research on aging treats white people as the default or baseline and
effectively “others” Black people and people of color [12]. Further,
they note that race is under-examined in HCI research on aging
and older adults, with only four studies examining how “the race
of participants as it intersects with technology requirements” [ 12].
22CSCW ’23 Companion, October 14–18, 2023, Minneapolis, MN, USA Roe and Marathe
Systematic reviews of the broader HCI literature have shown that
race is consistently and vastly under-reported in comparison to
other identity dimensions such as gender and age [ 12,14,26]. We
seek to address this gap pointed out by suggesting ways to improve
the reporting and analysis of race in HCI healthcare literature.
Healthcare-focused research in CSCW/HCI often seeks to un-
cover and address sources of bias and racism in healthcare, as the
HCI subfield most invested in improving the lives of stakeholders
in the healthcare ecosystem. For instance, Veinot et al. demonstrate
that healthcare informatics interventions can amplify inequality
because they are “more accessible to, heavily used by, adhered to, or
effective for those from socioeconomically advantaged groups” [ 29].
Walker et al. show that incentive structures in the field of public
health intensify inequities by discouraging experts from collabo-
rating with Black women and reproductive justice advocates who
are not well represented in the public health domain [ 32]. Pendse
et al. show that the standards and artifacts used in digital mental
health tools may exacerbate the inequities faced by historically
minoritized groups [ 22]. Despite this excellent and timely work,
little attention has been paid to how the term race is defined and
used in healthcare-focused subfield of HCI. To our knowledge, we
are the first to critically examine race in HCI healthcare research.
3 METHODS
We conducted a systematic review [ 17] of two major HCI venues,
the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
and Social Computing (CSCW) and the ACM CHI Conference on
Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI). We searched the
ACM Digital Library for articles that mentioned race and healthcare.
We used queries such as “race AND (medicine OR healthcare)” to
ensure that articles dealt with both topics, and filtered articles by
proceedings to focus on CHI and CSCW. We included all articles
from the results in the first phase of the review (n=514).
After removing duplicate records (n=51), we screened abstracts
to narrow the list to articles that explicitly discussed race in the
context of healthcare. In the case of articles that did not discuss race
or healthcare, we searched for the terms “race,” “racial,” “racism,”
“healthcare,” “medicine,” and “medical” in the full text of the article
to find where the topic was discussed. Articles were included in the
next step if they contained any mention of race and were discussing
topics relevant to healthcare. Papers were excluded if they met any
of the following exclusion criteria: (a) the paper used the word race
in reference to something other than racial categories and racialized
interactions, such as car racing games [ 13]; b) the paper had no
connection to the healthcare fields, such as papers dealing solely
with law enforcement [ 18]; c) the paper was not a research study,
literature review, or essay, such as the introduction to conference
proceedings or workshops [ 34]; and d) the paper mentioned race
and healthcare entirely independently of each other. For instance,
a paper on the legalization of same-sex marriage refers separately
to healthcare access and racism [2].
This resulted in a set of 29 papers. We conducted a thematic anal-
ysis on these articles [ 6]. We developed a set of themes that were
used to code each article including study characteristics (e.g., meth-
ods), how race is defined (e.g., social construct versus biological
category), how race is operationalized (e.g., the list of categories),
Figure 1: Flowchart of literature selection process according
to PRISMA guidelines [21].
and how race appears in the article (e.g., the article meaningfully
engages with race throughout versus mentioning it in future work).
The first author conducted the coding after reading through each ar-
ticle. Both authors met weekly to discuss newly coded data, clarify
thematic categories, and develop emergent observations. Once cod-
ing was complete, we analyzed each theme to identify trends across
articles. In terms of positionality, we are two researchers with five
years of experience working with racialized groups in healthcare
settings in the United States. We recognize that our findings will
be shaped by our identities and circumstances. The first author is a
white cisgender woman who grew up in a suburban working class
family in the Midwest. The second author is a disabled transgender
non-binary person of color. They grew up in an urban, middle class,
and privileged caste family in India. Results from our analysis are
laid out in the following sections.
4 FINDINGS
4.1 Study Characteristics
The articles that we examined included empirical studies, literature
reviews, and essays. Empirical studies employed a range of methods
including interviews, focus groups, photo elicitation, and surveys,
with sample sizes ranging from 20-40 participants for interview
studies and 42-267 for survey studies. Most studies (n=22) focused
on the perspectives of patients and health technology users. Few
studies (n=4) examined the perspectives of healthcare practitioners.
Some studies sought to uncover and address the needs and chal-
lenges of specific minority groups such as immigrant women (n=9),
whereas others designed tools to address previously identified needs
such as peer support for patients (n=12).
4.2 Unclear and Inconsistent Race Definitions
All articles in our data set directly referenced race or racism, but 72%
of articles (n=21) did not define what they meant by race and left the
notion of race implicit. Different articles interpreted the term race
differently to mean physical appearance, sociocultural background,
ethnic identity, nationality, or country of origin without present-
ing definitions or justifications, suggesting a lack of clarity and
consensus around the definition of race in HCI healthcare research.
23Examining Race in Healthcare-Focused HCI Research CSCW ’23 Companion, October 14–18, 2023, Minneapolis, MN, USA
Most articles (n=22) named the racial categories that participants
belonged to, but the set of categories used as well as their level of
specificity varied between articles. Some articles used categories
drawn from the US Census, operationalizing race using the fol-
lowing list: White, Black or African American, American Indian or
Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
In contrast, other articles provided “other” as the only alternative
to the White/Caucasian, Black/African American, and Asian cate-
gories. Two articles clubbed racial and ethnic categories together,
for example using Latinx and Afro-Caribbean as racial categories.
Further, 24% of articles (n=7) failed to mention whether partici-
pants’ racial identities were self-reported, researcher-assigned, or
otherwise inferred. Additionally, two studies used the words race
and culture interchangeably, always when referencing minoritized
racial identities and non-white or non-western societies (e.g., Afro-
Caribbean people). That is, some studies implicitly equate racial
difference with cultural difference without justification.
4.3 Limited Engagement with Race and Racism
Many articles engaged with race in a very limited manner. For
example, articles mentioned race in passing without further discus-
sion about race, racism, or racial processes in empirical data, data
analysis, conceptual theorization, or design (i.e., race was absent in
most of the paper). 38% of studies (n=11) described racial identity in
the context of participant demographics and recruitment, but nei-
ther analyzed race as a dimension of difference in the findings nor
presented negative findings about the lack of difference along racial
lines. This absence was echoed in the discussion, design implica-
tions, and subsequent sections of such papers. Studies thus reported
the racial makeup of recruited participants without substantially
engaging with race, racism, and racial disparities in healthcare.
Further, 14% of articles (n=4) proposed racial diversity and greater
awareness about racism as goals for future research, without at-
tending to racial dimensions in their own work (i.e., papers did not
themselves engage with race but suggested that future researchers
should do so). These articles either had an insufficiently diverse
sample of participants or developed a general purpose tool (e.g.,
a virtual nurse) that was hypothesized to be useful in addressing
racism. However, these articles left for future researchers the tasks
of evaluating the anti-racist potential of such tools and recruiting
diverse participants. In a refreshing contrast, ten articles substan-
tively engaged with race and racial disparities.
Finally, 20% of articles (n=6) used cultural differences to explain
the relationship between race and health disparities. For example,
studies discussed how cultural variation in diet, family routines, and
views on health management impacted the outcomes of non-white
marginalized communities, typically leading to higher rates of ill-
ness and mortality. Studies also attributed negative experiences of
immigrants of color with the US healthcare system to cultural differ-
ences with their country of origin, citing reasons such as differing
norms around doctor-patient communication. Thus, these studies
held that cultural differences contributed to health disparities.
5 DISCUSSION
We sought to examine how race is used in healthcare-focused HCI
research. Based on a thematic analysis of 29 articles, we foundthat race is frequently left undefined and there is considerable
variation in how race is operationalized across studies. Further,
articles failed to substantially engage with race. We briefly discuss
the implications of these findings.
5.1 Clarity and Consistency in the Use of Race
We found that the majority of articles did not define what they
meant by race and left the notion of race implicit. The absence of
definitions for commonly used terms could be part of a larger trend
in HCI literature: Stowell and colleagues’ review article on mobile
health technology, for example, shows that the literature frequently
uses terms like “barriers to [healthcare] access” yet rarely defines
the term or specifies the barriers being referred to in a given in-
stance [ 28]. Missing or implied definitions of key terms require
readers to make assumptions that may not always be correct, risk-
ing potential misinterpretation of findings and inconsistency in
findings across studies. This insight on the lack of a clear definition
for race in HCI healthcare literature is consistent with critical anal-
yses of medical literature: sociologists have shown that medical
research lacks consensus around the terms race and ethnicity [ 27].
We recommend that researchers clearly lay out what they mean by
race and other important terms, especially when definitions can
vary as with race (which can refer to appearance, social grouping,
ethnic background, ancestry, nationality, and country of origin).
We join recent calls from medical literature suggesting that “defin-
ing race is essential to interpret individual studies and to facilitate
comparisons” [ 33]. That is, clear definitions of race would allow
researchers to compare and synthesize across the many HCI health-
care studies that are beginning to examine racism and disparities.
Participants’ racial identities can be self reported, researcher
identified, or inferred from other information such as an established
database. We found that several articles failed to specify the mode of
data collection used to obtain participant demographics. Best prac-
tice guidelines suggest that race information should be gathered via
self-report to ensure that it accurately reflects participant identity
[33]. Given the variability in definitions of race across articles, we
suggest that studies include information about how demographic
data was collected to clarify the specific operationalization of race
used in a given study and appropriately contextualize its findings.
When analyzing findings or comparing results across studies, we
propose that researchers recognize that race is an evolving and
fluid construct that may be defined differently in differing contexts
and times [ 4,23]. Finally, we urge researchers to consider whether
racial identity information is relevant to the questions they seek
to answer. Collecting racial identity information without justifica-
tion can have negative consequences: cross-group comparisons can
stigmatize individual communities (instead of focusing on systemic
inequities), participants from smaller populations risk exposure
and re-identification, and identity information can be misused for
profiling and discrimination [8–11, 15, 19].
5.2 Engage with Race and Health Disparities
In our data set, it was common to see minor mentions of race in
participant demographics and as an avenue for future work. Given
the widespread racial disparities in the healthcare system, we sug-
gest that the analysis should go further and examine racism, racial
24CSCW ’23 Companion, October 14–18, 2023, Minneapolis, MN, USA Roe and Marathe
disparities, and race as a category of human difference in greater
depth. Without dedicating substantial effort and space in the ar-
ticle towards such analyses, the inclusion of racial identity data
in demographics and minor mentions in future work seem per-
formative and disingenuous, because they make empty gestures
towards racial diversity and brush off the topic of race for later
investigation. We suggest that there needs to be higher race con-
sciousness in healthcare-focused HCI research. Perhaps a first step
would be to educate ourselves about structural and interpersonal
racism in healthcare and society both historically and in the present
[3, 5, 24, 30, 31].
Socioeconomically disadvantaged racial groups are adversely
impacted by health disparities, i.e., higher rates of illness and death,
than the rest of the population. We found that several articles in our
data set assumed that cultural differences led to health disparities.
This conceptualization is a grave misconception that ignores the ef-
fects of systemic racism that systematically produces obstacles such
as “social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage” faced by
socioeconomically disadvantaged racial groups [ 7,30]. Further, arti-
cles that emphasized cultural differences tended to use white people
and mainstream American culture as the reference group [ 12], im-
plying that the cultures of non-white people are inherently different
from white people, outside the mainstream, and un-American. This
deeply problematic other-ization of non-white people ignores the
fact that “racism – not race – drives health disparities” [1, 30].
5.3 Examine Expert Practice and Institutions
We found that most articles focused on the perspectives of patients
and health technology users, indicating a focus on individual chal-
lenges rather than systemic challenges or challenges faced at the
level of practitioners and institutions. Race-conscious HCI literature
naturally centers patients and communities as groups that are most
vulnerable to harm by flawed systems, a focus likely arising from the
user-centered paradigm in HCI and the patient-centered approach
in healthcare. However, it also points to the need for race-conscious
research that generates implications for practitioners and institu-
tions. For example, HCI has a long tradition of studying the work
practices of healthcare practitioners, but our review only found
four such articles. This indicates a need for more attentiveness to
issues of race when studying practitioners and institutions. Studies
from adjacent fields provide examples of efforts to investigate sys-
temic issues, such as a health services research study examining
how practitioner and institutional biases contribute to disparities
in diagnostic imaging based on an analysis of over 300,000 emer-
gency room visits [ 25]. While community based approaches help
understand minoritized groups’ experiences, we propose that HCI
healthcare scholars must also examine expert practice and institu-
tional processes to advance the goal of addressing systemic racism.
5.4 Limitations and Future Work
Our observations are limited to two major venues in the field of HCI
(CHI and CSCW). Given the high selectivity (i.e., low acceptance
rates) of these venues, our hope was to examine how race is repre-
sented in highly regarded HCI healthcare research. However, we
did not analyze articles from other venues and so our findings may
not extend to other HCI venues and fields. Further, we prioritizedarticles mentioning race in the context of medicine and healthcare,
and as a result our findings may not generalize to HCI research
outside healthcare settings. We hope to broaden our analysis in the
future, and suggest that future work should take a broader view
of the literature by incorporating other venues and repositories
(such as the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library).
Future research should also draw inspiration from domains outside
healthcare that engage substantively with race and racism.
6 CONCLUSION
We systematically reviewed healthcare-focused literature in pro-
ceedings of the ACM CHI and CSCW conferences. We found that
race was left undefined in many articles and inconsistently op-
erationalized across articles. Further, we found that articles did
not always engage meaningfully with race, despite including eq-
uity considerations in recruitment and future work. We conclude
with suggestions to help future HCI healthcare research engage
substantively with race.
