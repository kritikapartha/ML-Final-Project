ABSTRACT 
Transnational        
to a new country, rely on consumer-to-consumer electronic com-
merce (C2C e-commerce) to access local resources for adaptation. 
However, with low trust among transnational newcomers who en-
ter a new country, they often face difculties in the adaptation 
process, and little is known about which determinants afect their 
trust in C2C e-commerce. Because social identity is often compli-
cated in transnational newcomers’ adaptation process, our work 
focuses on unpacking shared identity, a key trust antecedent in C2C 
e-commerce. We interviewed 12 transnational newcomers in the 
United States to identify the determinants of their shared identity 
in C2C e-commerce. Our preliminary results suggest that shared 
identity determinants include geographic proximity, ethnic back-
ground, life stage, and socio-economic status. We also uncovered 
ways that shared identity determinants infuence transnational new-
comers’ trust in local C2C e-commerce. Our work contributes two 
research implications to future studies on transnational newcomers’ 
technology use. newcomers, i.e., foreign-born populations who move

1 INTRODUCTION 
Social         
ger applications play an important role in transnational newcomers’ 
adaptation1. Transnational newcomers utilize social technologies 
to exchange information for adaptation needs with other newcom-
ers [5, 10, 20]. This use of social technologies allows transnational 
newcomers to gain information about the legal documentation pro-
cess and local cultural knowledge to live in the destination country. 
In addition to information-seeking, transnational newcomers par-
ticipate in local consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce to seek 
adaptation resources, such as items and services, in the destination 
country. These newcomers depend on C2C e-commerce platforms 
such as Craigslist, neighborhood Facebook groups, or local commu-
nity WhatsApp groups, to trade resources and network with other 
people in their local area [16]. 
An essential element of C2C e-commerce is trust, i.e., a person’s 
confdence in depending on another party [30]. However, transna-
tional newcomers need time to develop trust as they adapt to the 
destination country [6, 7]. The uncertainty and potential risks of on-
line activities can hinder these newcomers’ use of online platforms 
to access local resources [12, 15, 16]. Thus, our study investigated 
transnational newcomers’ trust in local C2C e-commerce . Specifcally, 
our work focused on shared identity, a critical trust determinant in 
C2C e-commerce [3, 21, 24, 25]. Shared identity refers to the similar 
personal attributes shared among individuals. Past work suggests 
that shared ethnic background is one shared identity determinant 
of transnational newcomers’ choices of social applications for net-
working and resource-seeking [16], but it is unclear whether other 
shared identity determinants afect this population’s trust in local 
C2C e-commerce. Our work dug deeper to unpack what shared 
identity means to transnational newcomers’ participation in local 
C2C e-commerce, and how shared identity infuences their trust in 
local C2C e-commerce. We aimed to answer the following research 
questions in the present work: 
• What are the determinants of transnational newcomers’ 
shared identity in local C2C e-commerce? 
• How do the shared identity determinants afect transnational 
newcomers’ trust in local C2C e-commerce? 
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 transnational 
newcomers in the United States (US) in November and Decem-
ber 2020. Our results suggest that, to transnational newcomers, technologies such as social network sites and instant messen -
1We use transnational newcomers to refer to populations that are born outside of a 
country and migrate to a new country in their adulthood regardless of their legal 
status. This defnition covers, but is not limited to, permanent immigrants, foreign 
employers, and international students. We chose the word “newcomer” to emphasize 
that their duration in the destination country is relatively short.CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Hsiao and Dillahunt 
shared identity is determined by close geographic proximity, simi-
lar life stages, shared ethnicity, and similar socio-economic status 
when they participate in local C2C e-commerce. We also found that 
transnational newcomers’ experience in local C2C e-commerce 
varies across diferent types of platforms. We conclude our work by 
providing research recommendations for future work on transna-
tional newcomers’ technology use and trust development in local 
C2C e-commerce. 
2 RELATED WORK 
In this section, we review prior literature on 1) transnational new-
comers’ technology use for adaptation and 2) shared identity in 
C2C e-commerce to frame our research scope. 
2.1 Transnational Newcomers’ Technology Use 
for Adaptation 
Trading items, services, and information within local communities 
is common for transnational newcomers to access resources and 
develop social connections even without using online platforms [27, 
31]. These transactions allow transnational newcomers to receive 
needed information and resources for adapting to a country and 
expose them to networking opportunities within local communities 
[27, 31]. With the development of the Internet, social media have 
become a channel supporting people under life transitions [13], 
including transnational newcomers [5, 10, 11, 20]. For example, 
Dekker and Elgram conducted a series of in-depth interviews with 
90 immigrants in the Netherlands to understand how social media 
applications infuenced their migration decisions and processes 
[5]. The researchers found that social media applications allowed 
immigrants to develop networks with people who had a shared 
ethnic background in the destination country. Using social media 
applications for networking facilitated newcomers’ adaptation by 
exposing them to local resources such as information and services. 
In another study, Erdem interviewed 30 immigrants in California, 
U.S., and found that their use of social media applications, especially 
Facebook groups for local communities, exposed them to inter-
cultural contact with local populations [10]. Erdem argued that 
social technologies can boost transnational newcomers’ adaptation 
by exposing them to language resources and news of the destination 
country. 
Recent HCI studies have explored technology design opportuni-
ties to address the needs of transnational newcomers, or immigrants 
in general, in domains such as parenting and education [1, 4, 32, 33], 
resource-seeking [16, 26], online security and privacy [12], and 
identity transition [8, 23, 28]. Among these studies, trust has been 
found to be a critical factor of transnational newcomers’ online 
activities in the destination country, and shared ethnicity was a 
key antecedent of this population’s trust [ 12, 16]. While these stud-
ies shed light on transnational newcomers’ needs and ways that 
technology design can help, a deeper look into their trust develop-
ment is missing. Our work contributes to this literature by studying 
transnational newcomers’ trust development in the context of local 
C2C e-commerce, with a focus on the role of shared identity. 2.2 Shared Identity in C2C E-commerce 
The shared identity among platform users is one key trust deter-
minant in C2C e-commerce [21, 24, 25]. In past C2C e-commerce 
research, shared identity has referred to the similar personal at-
tributes shared among platform users. Lu et al. conducted an online 
survey to examine how similarities such as goals, interests, and val-
ues afect trust among users of C2C e-commerce [24]. Their results 
suggest that these high-level similarities among users positively 
afect a user’s trust in other users’ integrity and benevolence on a 
platform. Recent qualitative studies unpacked the determinants of 
shared identity among diferent populations in C2C e-commerce. 
Moser et al. studied Facebook groups for buying-and-selling second-
hand goods among mothers who lived in the same geographic area 
[25]. This study found that the shared identity of motherhood fos-
ters members’ trust in the community on these groups. This study 
found that living in neighborhoods nearby and the shared identity 
as a mother supported members’ trust in these groups. In another 
study, Lampinen et al. deployed a local C2C e-commerce platform 
for single parents in California [21] and found that the shared 
identity as single parents supported participants’ long-term inter-
personal trust in other members. Participants’ trust based on shared 
identity helped them feel safe to make risky transactions, such as 
childcare services or carpools to school for their children, with 
other members on the platform. 
This prior literature acknowledges how shared identity fosters 
two populations’ trust in local C2C e-commerce. This research im-
plies it is necessary to understand diferent populations’ shared 
identities and associated needs in C2C e-commerce. Past HCI work 
on transnational newcomers’ online resource-seeking touched on 
their shared identity [16], suggesting that a shared ethnic back-
ground is a key determinant. Our work extends this literature by 
digging deeper into what determines transnational newcomers’ 
shared identity in local C2C e-commerce, and how these shared 
identity determinants afect their trust in this context. 
3 METHODS 
Participant Recruitment. Our recruitment spanned from October 
to December 2020. We defned transnational newcomers as those 
who were 1) foreign-born and had lived in the U.S. for ten or fewer 
years, and 2) 18 years or older when they moved to the U.S. We did 
not sample for other demographic factors (e.g., age, education, or 
race). 
We frst advertised our study with a screening survey on public 
social platforms, such as Craigslist’s volunteer sections and neigh-
borhood Facebook groups in over ten U.S. cities. The survey asked 
about a respondent’s country of birth, year of migration, most 
recent experience in local C2C e-commerce, and contact informa-
tion. We recruited six (N=6) eligible participants through online 
advertisements. Because the recruitment through public advertise-
ments went slowly, we employed the second recruitment strategy 
by recruiting through professional survey panels. We deployed 
the screening survey on Prolifc2, which had predefned screening 
criteria for us to target foreign-born populations living in the U.S. 
2Prolifc (https://prolifc.co) is an online survey platform that allows researchers to 
purchase a panel to recruit survey participants. Each panelist was paid 0.32 USD for 
completing our screening survey.Shared Identity’s Role in Transnational Newcomers’ Trust in Local C2C E-commerce CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan

We received 200 responses from Prolifc, but only 16 respondents 
were newcomers with local C2C e-commerce experience. After we 
reached out to these 16 respondents, six (N=6) of them participated 
in the study. 
Study Procedure. The present work is a part of an umbrella 
project to understand transnational newcomers’ trust in online 
resource-seeking. We developed our interview protocol by adapt-
ing questions from past studies on trust in local C2C e-commerce to 
our context (mostly survey studies) [17, 18, 22, 25]. The interviewer 
started by asking participants to recall their most recent local C2C 
e-commerce transaction. Based on participants’ experience, the 
interviewer then probed with questions that were focused on trust 
regarding their use of the platform. The interviewer then asked 
whether and how shared identity infuenced their trust in local C2C 
e-commerce with the question: “Have you found yourself to be simi-
lar or dissimilar with other members on the platform? Why did you 
feel so?” The interviewer then followed up with the question: “How 
does the feeling of being similar (dissimilar) infuence your use of the 
platform? ” We also asked: “Compared to the time when you were new 
in the U.S, has your use of the platform changed? ” to capture whether 
their local C2C e-commerce experiences evolved as they adapted to 
the U.S. Each interview lasted approximately 60 minutes. Besides 
shared identity, we also explored other trust determinants in C2C 
e-commerce in the interview, such as perceived social presence and 
social support [18], which we leave for future work. Participants 
were asked to respond to a closing survey to report their detailed 
demographic information after the interview. All the interviews 
were conducted remotely through Zoom between November and 
December 2020. Our study was approved as an exempt study by our 
institutional review board (IRB). All the materials used in the study, 
including the recruitment post, surveys, and interview protocols, 
were designed in English. Participants received a 30 USD electronic 
gift card as compensation, which they were able to choose from 
Amazon, Target, or Walmart. 
Participant Overview. Table 1 presents the participants’ demo-
graphic information. We had more women participants (N=7) than 
men (N=5). Participants’ average age was 29, and their duration 
living in the U.S. was 5 years on average. Half of the participants’ 
race was White (N=6); the other half consisted of Black (N=3) and 
Asian (N=3). All except two participants had a bachelor”s degree; 
the other two participants reported their educational background as some college. Four participants (N=4) migrated to the U.S. as a 
family member or spouse of a U.S. citizen or permanent immigrant; 
four (N=4) participants moved as an international student; the other 
participants migrated because they or their spouse got a job in the 
U.S. (N=3), and because they won the U.S. green card lottery3 (N=1). 
Data Analysis. The interviews were audio-recorded and profes-
sionally transcribed, and we used4  Atlas.ti to analyze the tran-
scriptions. In the frst round of coding, the frst author reviewed the 
data line-by-line and adopted structural coding to identity quotes 
associated with shared identity and trust in participants’ local C2C 
e-commerce experience [29]. The frst author then gathered the 
highlighted quotes to generate themes as a codebook. 
4 RESULTS 
Our         
comers’ shared identity in local C2C e-commerce, and how these 
determinants afect their trust in local C2C e-commerce. We frst 
found that participants’ experience in local C2C e-commerce var-
ied based on the type of platforms they used. We observed that 
platforms that supported other online activities beyond C2C trans-
actions, such as neighborhood Facebook groups or NextDoor, pro-
vided opportunities for participants to engage in local communities. 
In these cases, newcomers’ ofine trust in their neighborhoods and 
trust in users on a platform mutually fostered each side. On the 
other hand, participants who relied on the other platforms that 
were pure online marketplaces for local C2C e-commerce, such as 
Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or OferUp, used these platforms 
only when they had material needs or looked for income opportuni-
ties, such as local gigs or paid research studies. These platforms had 
limited to no spaces for casual interactions among platform users. 
In these cases, participants’ trust was limited to trust in users on a 
platform but did not convert to trust in their ofine communities. 
Our results suggest that shared identity is multifaceted and that 
each aspect of shared identity infuences participants’ trust in local 
C2C e-commerce in a diferent way. Participants’ trust was afected 
by the following aspects of shared identity: close geographic prox-
imity, a similar life stage, a similar ethnic background, and similar 
socio-economic status. We present the results regarding each deter-
minant in the rest of this section. study aimed to identify the determinants of transnational new -
4.1 Close Geographic Proximity 
Being in close geographic proximity was the top shared identity 
determinant stated by participants. Being in a close geographic 
area with other users in C2C e-commerce allowed transnational 
newcomers to develop trust by 1) converting trust in neighborhoods 
to trust in local C2C e-commerce, 2) maintaining control of ofine 
locations to meet, and 3) developing a sense of belonging through 
online activities. 
4.1.1 Converting Trust in Neighborhoods to Trust in Local C2C E-
commerce. Being in the same geographic areas allowed participants 
to convert their ofine trust in their neighborhoods to an online

trust in the user community on a platform. Five participants (P1, P2, 
P4, P7, P9) stated that they were familiar with their neighborhoods, 
so they trusted these users who were also local. For example, Emily 
(P1), who migrated to the U.S. because she won a green card lottery, 
and her family needed to move to a diferent state every few years 
because of her husband’s job. Emily described how living in the 
same neighborhood with other users on Craigslist fostered her trust: 
“Let’s say I fnd something in Craigslist that is posted and it happens 
to be a neighbor of mine. I will probably go there by myself because I 
know the neighborhood. So it was like, what kind of risks am I taking 
with the amount that I’m going to save by buying something here in 
the neighborhood. But if the same item was next town where I don’t 
know anyone, I probably wouldn’t go by myself.” 
Not only did newcomers’ ofine trust in neighborhoods convert 
to online trust in C2C e-commerce, but their distrust did also. Ann 
(P2), who married a U.S. citizen and migrated to the U.S. in 2020, 
stated that she knew some unsafe neighborhoods in her area, so she 
avoided transactions in those areas on Craigslist. Mert (P7), who 
was an international student and moved to the U.S. in 2018, had 
an experience buying a second-hand bike from, as he described, 
an insecure neighborhood, through Craigslist: “It wasn’t a very 
secure neighborhood, I would say. I felt I wasn’t really trusting the 
guy [seller] in the frst place, but I really liked the item, the bike... 
Eventually, I came home and then I saw some problems with the 
bike... There are some neighborhoods, you feel secure... But there are 
some neighborhoods that you don’t. So it was kind of one of those 
neighborhoods, I guess.” 
4.1.2 Maintaining Control of Ofline Locations to Meet. All partici-
pants mentioned that they negotiated the location to meet ofine 
for the transaction with another party. Two participants (P3, P9) 
stated that being able to select locations to meet made them feel 
safe. Shakir (P3) stated that having control of the ofine location 
to meet mitigated his perceived risks and improved his trust in a 
transaction: “It’s actually like this person [seller] was trustworthy, 
because they just told me that, for example, like me, that a certain 
parking lot to take the tools [to sell]. And it was close to me, it wasn’t 
very far from me... I felt like this person was doing their best to make 
a very good experience, and a safe experience.” 
When the buyer or seller involved in a transaction invited a new-
comer to visit their home, participants also developed trust in the 
buyer/seller. Two participants (P1, P8) had this type of experience 
and described their trust development as a mutual process. Being 
invited to someone’s house suggested to them that the buyer/seller 
trusted the participants, and thus the participants developed trust 
in the buyer/seller. Sara (P8), who moved to the U.S. as a family-
reunion migrant in 2011, described her experience using NextDoor 
to fnd a parking lot to rent in her neighborhood. Sara described her 
feeling when a person who was willing to lease the parking lot to 
her invited her to their house: “[The parking lot owners] said, ‘Okay, 
we would like to meet you frst. ’ Because they wanted to see they can 
trust us as well. So we went over their house one night after work. And 
we have a discussion for the background, what we do, where we live... 
So I think that was a very trusting moment that they invited us to 
their home.” 
4.1.3 Developing a Sense of Belonging through Online Interactions. 
The online interactions on local C2C e-commerce platforms also fostered participants’ trust in the user community. Platforms such 
as neighborhood Facebook groups and NextDoor ofered online 
spaces for casual conversations such as sharing daily news and local 
information among group members. By soaking in this information 
and familiarizing themselves with the neighborhood’s social norms, 
two participants (P5, P8) developed trust. Hang (P5) moved to the 
U.S. to start college in 2015, and she was a member of a Facebook 
group for her neighborhood. In addition to having C2C transactions 
within the group, she often observed members’ discussions about 
local news and events. As she lived in the area longer, Hang was 
able to understand the inside jokes regarding the neighborhood in 
the group. Familiarizing herself with the neighborhood’s culture 
fostered Hang’s identity as a local community member, which in-
creased her trust: “Because sometimes the people [in the Facebook 
group] have inside jokes that only people in our neighborhood can 
understand. And it makes me feel closer. It makes me feel like the 
community is just a few more nice people... So just acts of kindness 
and just community jokes that people have inside a group that makes 
me feel closer and better as part of the group.” 
4.2 Similar Life Stage 
Being in a similar life stage fostered participants’ trust in another 
user and in a user community. One shared life stage stated by two 
participants (P4, P11) was being a transnational newcomer to the 
U.S. Juliana (P11), who was an international student, described that 
she looked for a roommate through a Facebook trading group con-
sisting of students from her college. Juliana said that she decided to 
live with her current roommate because they shared the same iden-
tity as an international student. However, the two participants (P4, 
P11) also stated that their engagement in these platforms decreased 
after they transitioned from a newcomer to an established migrant. 
Aparna (P4), who migrated to the U.S. in 2017 because her husband 
got a job in the U.S., joined multiple WhatsApp groups for Indian 
women in her local area. These groups were for buy-and-sell within 
local Indian women communities, and the members also exchanged 
information for adaptation in these groups. Aparna described how 
her use of these groups decreased as her duration living in the U.S. 
increased: “When I was a newcomer, I was a frequent user [of the 
WhatsApp groups]. I used to frequently, I used to keep on checking 
my phone. I was frequently asking questions, I was regularly seeking 
out certain members of the group whom I thought were very similar 
to me and I was making a lot of eforts to get to know them and I used 
to go and meet out. And I was making a lot of eforts in making new 
relations. Now that I do not need any of that, I’m just a mere spectator 
unless I need something.” Juliana (P11) also stated that “I think that 
when I was a freshman, I used to use it [the Facebook group] way 
more than what I use right now.” This suggests that 1 year could be 
sufcient for transnational newcomers to become established and 
reduce their dependence on local C2C e-commerce. 
In addition to their shared identity as a newcomer to the U.S., the 
marriage and family status as a shared identity infuenced partici-
pants’ trust (P1, P4, P8, P10) in local C2C e-commerce. Emily (P1) 
was the mother of two kids. Emily believed that other members 
on Craigslist were also local families with similar needs, so C2C 
transactions could be a reliable way for mutual assistance: “The 
things that I’m looking for, household things, are families like myShared Identity’s Role in Transnational Newcomers’ Trust in Local C2C E-commerce CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan 
family. They have kids like I have, they need things like I need. They 
need to get rid of stuf like I do when kids grow. I mean, there’s the 
same thing. They are going through the same things that we are, in 
some way.” 
4.3 Shared Ethnicity 
A shared ethnicity refers to the same or similar cultural background. 
Notably, we did not fnd a salient association between participants’ 
trust and common cultural background. Although a participant 
(Aparna [P4]) described that the shared cultural background with 
other Indian women in WhatsApp groups helped her fnd needed 
information for immigration documentation and international trav-
elling, her experience did not suggest an association between a 
shared ethnicity and trust. 
However, the shared ethnicity could improve a newcomer’s trust 
in local C2C e-commerce by providing access to latent ties within 
an ethnic community. Latent ties are existing social ties that are not 
activated, such as people who work for the same company but do 
not know each other [14]. Latent ties among an ethnic community 
were cited by Maduka (P12) as a safety mechanism that reduced his 
perceived risks of C2C transactions. Maduka moved to the U.S. as 
an international student from Nigeria in 2011. Maduka preferred to 
have local C2C transactions with people from his home country on 
Craigslist, because the latent ties allowed him to have more control 
over his transactions: “I like [relying on] people that come from the 
same country I come from because they’re more... Let me say that we 
have some connections. I can easily track them. I can easily get my 
item. I can track my item easily.” 
4.4 Similar Socio-economic Status 
The last determinant of shared identity we found was a similar socio-
economic status. Although other users’ socio-economic status is 
not public information, participants utilized posts on a platform 
to assess other users’ socio-economic status. Kristina migrated 
because she got a job in the U.S. in 2016, and she used a few Facebook 
groups for local C2C e-commerce. Kristina described that by seeing 
items that other members traded, and sometimes their Facebook 
profles, she was able to assess a person’s socio-economic status. 
Kristina believed that most of the same group users were in a similar 
socio-economic status and had similar needs. Kristina believed that 
C2C transactions provided a way to help one another address needs 
in common: “You feel like there exist people on the same level as you. 
I think because if I would be of higher income I would buy toys [for 
kids] by myself. I would not ask for yours... Yes, it’s encouraged me to 
use more and I also feel more confdent because I know that in case 
if I really need something and really don’t have something, I have 
resources who can help.” 
Another example was stated by Ann (P2), who had a medical 
doctoral degree from South Korea. Besides the transactions for 
items on Craigslist, Ann often browsed posts that recruited research 
participants. Ann took these posts as a signal to suggest that other 
users were similar to her in terms of profession: “I can see there are 
researchers and scientists and there are some good causes and purposes 
that people are using Craigslist for... And I could see that they were 
real business and real people like myself, so they were similar to me... 
It increases my use, because I feel more comfortable.” 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Our work presents a preliminary study to unpack what shared 
identity means to transnational newcomers in their participation 
in local C2C e-commerce, and how each aspect of shared identity 
afects their trust. We identifed the following shared identity deter-
minants: geographic proximity, similar life stages, shared ethnicity, 
and similar socio-economic status. The geographic proximity was 
the top shared identity determinant among our participants. For 
newcomers who have less knowledge about their area, participating 
in local C2C e-commerce could increase their trust and engagement 
in their local communities. This fnding provides an explanation to 
past research that found a positive correlation between newcom-
ers’ adaptation level and their use of neighborhood-based social 
applications [11]. 
Although past research suggested that shared ethnicity is a 
key trust determinant of transnational newcomers’ technology 
use [12, 16], we found that shared ethnicity has a limited efect. 
An explanation of this discrepancy could result from the diferent 
contexts between our work and past work. Past works studied new-
comers’ online networking and general social activities, whereas 
our work focused on their participation in C2C e-commerce. Our 
results suggest that shared ethnicity has limited infuence on new-
comers’ trust when their online behaviors are merely commercial 
and material. 
Our results suggest two implications for our next steps and fu-
ture research. First, future research should narrow the scope of 
transnational newcomers to focus on the adaptation process. Our 
work used a 10-year duration as a screening criterion to cover a 
wider range of newcomers to explore how long their newcomer 
identity recognition lasted in the context of online resource-seeking. 
Our results suggest that participants’ newcomer identity recogni-
tion in this context lasted much shorter than ten years and was 
even shorter than the 5-year duration used in past research (e.g., 
[2, 9, 19]). Future research aims to explore transnational “new-
comers” should narrow down to populations with an even shorter 
duration in the host country (e.g., 1 year) as their technology uses 
also adapt to the host country as they become established, such 
as Aparna (P4) and Juliana’s (P11) examples in Subsec. 4.2. Our 
second research implication, which resulted from our limitations 
in screening platforms used by this populations, suggests that re-
searchers should distinguish types of C2C e-commerce platforms 
in future research. We observed participants’ deeper engagement 
in platforms that supported casual interactions among users, such 
as Facebook groups, NextDoor, or WhatsApp groups. In contrast, 
platforms that were designed for pure C2C transactions, such as 
Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and OferUp, were used to ad-
dress the material needs of our participants. Future research on 
local C2C e-commerce platforms should distinguish platforms by 
accounting for the online activities that these platforms support. 
Moving forward, we plan to incorporate the research implica-
tions to continue discovering transnational newcomers’ trust in 
local C2C e-commerce. As we described in Methods, our inter-
view protocol covered other trust determinants such as perceived 
social presence and social support. Our next steps will look into 
these other trust determinants and also how the shared identity 
determinants collectively afect this population’s trust in local C2CCHI ’21 Extended Abstracts, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan 
e-commerce. We also plan to further unpack diferent forms of 
transnational newcomers’ trust in local C2C e-commerce.
