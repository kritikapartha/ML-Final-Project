ABSTRACT  
The rise of social networking mobile applications (apps) (e.g, 
Grindr, Jack’d) created specifically for men who have sex with 
men (MSM) has generated public health concerns and conflicting 
studies about the impact on risky sexual behaviors. This study seeks to gain a more precise understanding of why and how MSM are using social networking m obile apps, and informs the 
theoretical debate concerning th e impact of social networking 
technology on sexual risk behaviors. A questionnaire survey was 
conducted, both online and offline, with young MSM app-users in 
Hong Kong to examine their apps use (frequency, history, and 
exposure of own face and body) and recent sexual partnering via apps (total sexual partners [TSP] and condomless sex partners [CSP]) in relation to gratifications sought and sexual sensation seeking. The results indicated that finding sexual partners was not 
a high priority for using MSM apps; surveillance, relationship, 
and diversion motives were more important while social motive shared similar importance. App-use frequency, sex motive, and sexual sensation seeking predicted more TSP while surveillance motive predicted fewer TSP. None of these variables, however, directly predicted CSP. Sexual sensation seeking in interaction 
with sex or diversion motive predicted both TSP and CSP. 
Despite lacking significant association with sex motive or sexual sensation seeking, app-use frequency was a stronger independent predictor of TSP. While frequent app use may facilitate more app-met sexual partners, this study found no evidence indicating that app use promotes riskier sexual behavior with those partners.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The Internet and social networking sites (SNS) present a more 
socially accessible environment for men who have sex with men (MSM) to connect with each other [2, 11, 28]. With features such as anonymity and versatility, which may enable greater safety and control for users, SNS allow MSM to overcome the difficulties of making social connections in unmediated contexts [27, 28]. The 
recent rise of location-aware, social networking mobile 
applications (apps)—such as Grindr and Jack’d—that are created specifically for MSM further affords a convenient means for MSM to locate nearby users with similar relational and sexual preferences [6, 28, 32]. These affordances, however, have also raised public health concerns about SNS’s role in the spread of 
HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) among MSM.  
To address those concerns, the present study adopts a uses and 
gratifications approach toward understanding app use and attendant sexual behaviors among young MSM in Hong Kong. The focus on young MSM app-users in Hong Kong is of practical 
significance owing to a confluence of several factors. First, Hong 
Kong is one of the most digitally connected international cities, boasting the third highest smartph one penetration rate (79%) in 
Asia Pacific [8]. A high level of digital connectivity coupled with the social stigma against homose xuality, low visibility of gay 
people, and other conservative cultural norms in Hong Kong [21] 
render SNS a primary channel for young MSM to connect with 
other MSM [cf. 2]. Second, MSM aged 25 years or younger in Hong Kong are disproportionately af fected by HIV compared to 
non-MSM in the same age group and constitute a rising proportion of new HIV infections among MSM [see 41]. Third, a 
younger age is the most consistent correlate of app use identified 
in previous studies conducted with a general MSM sample [5, 14, 
31, 35].  
2.  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
2.1 MSM Apps Use and Sexual Risk Behaviors 
Although most studies have found that MSM app-users tend to 
report greater numbers of sexual partners than non-users [5, 23, 
35], there is less consensus on the relationship between app use Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or

1 of 9and sexual risk-taking. Severa l studies have observed greater 
incidence of condomless anal sex and STI in MSM who use apps 
to meet sexual partners [22, 23,  35]. Other studies, however, have 
noted that MSM reported higher rates of condom use with partners met via apps than with those met via other means [33] or 
no significant differences between them [5]. These conflicting findings have prompted questions about whether app use promote 
riskier sexual behavior (“accentuation hypothesis”) or whether 
individuals who practice riskie r behavior are drawn to such 
technologies (“self-selection hypothesis”) [23]. A better 
understanding of the socio-psychological antecedents and underlying motives of MSM app-users may help to clarify this longstanding controversy.   
Prior research has mostly compared the differences in rates of 
sexual partnering and condomless anal sex between app-users and non-users, overlooking the differences in gratifications sought from apps among users and the attendant impact on sexual behaviors. Besides finding sexual partners, apps also serve 
socializing purposes for MSM such as seeking relationships and 
affiliating with the gay community [6, 16, 22, 33]. Although a few studies, mostly qualitative ones, have explored MSM’s gratifications sought from apps [e.g., 15, 28], there is little attempt to link those gratifications to behavioral consequences [see, for an exception, 38]. The differential e ffect of multiple app-use motives 
on attendant sexual behaviors remains underexamined. 
Furthermore, the narrow focus on sexual motives in using SNS 
meant that non-sexual motives and the risks or protections that may ensue from such pursuits have been neglected. For instance, there is growing evidence that underscores the influences of romantic motivations and relationship goals on risky sexual behaviors among MSM [4, 29, 41].     
2.2  Uses and Gratifications 
Uses and gratifications is an analytical framework that seeks to 
identify the motives for media use, specify social and 
psychological dispositions that influence these motives, and understand how motives and dispositions combined connect to patterns of use and other attendant behaviors [30]. Proponents of the uses and gratifications perspective, advocate that people are relatively aware of their needs and reasonably active and selective 
in seeking media choices that are perceived as satisfying their 
expectations [20]. Consequently, differential patterns of media use denote rational choices that people make to maximize their gratifications sought [25].  
Prior research has linked gratific ations sought from SNS use with 
a range of behavioral outcomes such as loneliness [24], 
nationalistic activism [18], and cross-cultural adaptation [39]. In the context of MSM apps use, Winetrobe, Rice, Bauermeister, Petering, and Holloway [40] noted that MSM app-users who had a longer history of app-use, displa yed naked chest or abs in their 
profile photo, and greater numbers of recent app-met partners 
were more likely to report condomless anal sex. Similarly, Van 
De wiele and Tong [38] found that Grindr users who were seeking 
romantic partners engage in more frequent and honest self-
disclosure of information. Extending this line of research, the present study examines MSM’s app use (frequency, history, and exposure of own face and body) and recent sexual partnering via 
apps (total sex partners and condomless sex partners) in relation 
to their gratifications sought and other relevant socio-psychological characteristics.     
In seeking to identify the salient gratifications sought from apps among MSM users, the present study is guided by the observation 
that new gratifications do emer ge with newer technologies and 
that some general gratifications become more nuanced and exact with such newer platforms [37]. While finding sex partners is an obvious motive [32], several studies have noted that MSM app-users also seek platonic and romantic contacts through apps [15, 16, 22, 33, 38]. Gay and bisexual men have reported using apps 
for social inclusion and peer validation needs such as community-
belonging and getting attention from  other app-users [15, 32, 38]. 
As with many types of media use, MSM-specific social networking apps also satisfy diversionary needs—escape or pass time [16, 33]. Where the use of such apps stands out for MSM are the anonymity and connectivity gratifications sought [28]. 
Notably, mobile apps equipped with location-based searching 
enables a new gratification of checking out MSM nearby [6, 32, 38].  
Besides demographic and background characteristics, uses and 
gratifications research has demons trated the role of various socio-
psychological attributes or predispositions in mediating the 
relationships between media use and outcomes. For instance, Chen and Kim [7] demonstrated that privacy concerns interact with gratifications sought on problem atic SNS use. Dhir et al. [12] 
show that adolescents who sc ore higher on unwillingness to 
communicate have a higher tendency to experience Internet 
addiction. Such psychological predispositions complement how 
the gratifications that are sought are met within their contextual environments [30]. Sexual sensat ion seeking, a proven correlate 
of sexual risk-taking among MSM [3], is the pertinent psychological predisposition investigated in the present study. Although prior research has demonstrated that sexual sensation seeking intervenes between Internet-use factors and sexual risk 
behaviors [13, 17, 26], the influe nce of sexual sensation seeking 
on MSM app use itself and its role in the relationship between gratifications sought and sexual partnering via apps remains unexplored.   
2.3  Research Questions  
RQ1 : What are the salient gratifications sought from MSM-
specific social networking mobile apps? 
RQ2 : How do gratifications sought and sexual sensation seeking 
relate to apps use? 
RQ3 : To what extent do gratifications sought and sexual 
sensation seeking predict sexual partnering via apps? 
RQ4 : How does sexual sensation seeking interact with 
gratifications sought on sexual partnering via apps?  
3.  METHODS 
3.1  Participants and Procedure 
A total of 259 participants completed the survey (189 online and 
70 offline). The final sample ( N = 213) was obtained after 
excluding non-eligible participants and those who provided erroneous responses (e.g., the total number of male sexual partners reported is less than the reported number of male condomless anal sex partners met through apps). Participants were young men ( M
age = 21.52 years, SD = 2.29) in Hong Kong, 
most of who identified themselves as homosexual (74.6%), 
ethnically Chinese (96.7%), single (63.2%), and had at least some 
college education (77.9%).  
Eligibility requirements, as stated in the questionnaire, were men 
aged 18 to 25 years, residing in Hong Kong, and, within the past 
six months, have had sexual contact with men and used MSM-
2 of 9specific social networking apps. Participants were recruited to 
complete the online questionnaire through messages posted on 
gay online forums, profiles created in MSM apps, and word-of-mouth referrals. Paper copies of the questionnaire were distributed at the Hong Kong Pride Parade and during an outreach to a bar district frequented by MSM. Social service organizations serving MSM also assisted in recruiting participants by 
encouraging their MSM stakeholders to fill out paper copies of 
the questionnaire at offline venues and by promoting the online questionnaire through the organizations’ social media accounts. Participants who completed the paper questionnaire received HK$50 (US$6.5) in cash or voucher while those completing the online questionnaire were told that they stood a chance to win 
vouchers worth HK$5,000 (US$650). Ethical approval for the 
study was obtained from the authors’ institutional review board.  
3.2  Measures  
3.2.1  MSM apps use  
Participants were asked to rate  their frequency of using MSM-
specific social networking mobile  apps on a 7-point scale (1 = 
Never , 2 = Less than once a month , 3 = A few times a month , 4 = 
A few times a week , 5 = Once a day , 6 = 2 to 4 times a day , 7 = 5 
or more times a day ), and their history of using such MSM apps 
on a 5-point scale (1 = Less than 3 months ago , 2 = 3 to 6 months 
ago, 3 = 6 months to 1 year ago , 4 = 1 year to 2 years ago , 5 = 
More than 2 years ago ). Levels of self-exposure were measured 
in terms of openly displayed face pictures (using a 3-point scale; 
1 = None of the pictures show my face , 2 = My face is partially 
hidden in the pictures , 3 = My face is clearly revealed in at least 
one picture ) and body pictures (using a 4-point scale; 0 = None of 
the pictures show my torso , 1 = I am fully clothed in all the 
pictures , 2 = I am partially clothed in the most revealing picture , 
3 = I am not clothed in the most revealing picture ).  
3.2.2  Gratifications sought from apps 
Motives for using MSM apps were measured by items adapted 
from Holloway et al. [16] and Van De Wiele and Tong [38]. Participants scored the 9 items using a 4-point scale from 1 = Very unimportant  to 4 = Very important. Exploratory factor 
analysis was conducted to examine the underlying dimensions of app-use motives. Using principal components analysis with a 
varimax rotation, a five-factor solution was obtained that 
explained 77.65% of the total variance (see Table 1). Individual items loaded strongly and distinctively with the relevant factors. The five dimensions of app-use motives were labeled diversion, 
surveillance, social, relationship, and sex. 
3.2.3  Sexual sensation seeking 
The 11-item Sexual Sensation Seeking Scale [19] was used to measure the extent to which participants seek and enjoy sexual 
experiences. Participants rated each statement (e.g., “I have said 
things that were not exactly true to get a person to have sex with me”) using a 5-point scale from 1 = Not at all like me  to 5 = Very 
much like me  (M = 2.55, SD = .51, Cronbach’s α = 0.86).  
3.2.4  Sexual partnering via apps 
Recent sexual partnering facilitated by MSM apps were assessed 
by the total number of sexual partners met via apps (TSP; “Among those men you had sexual contact with in the last 6 
months, how many of them did you meet via gay apps?”) and the number of condomless anal sex partners met via apps (CSP; 
“Among those men you met via gay apps in the last 6 months, 
how many of them did you have  anal sex without condoms?”), 
using an 8-point scale (1 = None , 2 = 1-3, 3 = 4-6, 4 = 7-9, 5 = 
10-12 , 6 = 13-15 , 7 = 16-18 , 8 = 19 or more ).

4.  RESULTS  
4.1  Descriptive Characteristics  
Three-quarters of the sample (75.0%) reported checking MSM apps at least several times a week and nearly half of all participants (48.8%) reported using such apps for more than two years. Nearly all participants reported using Jack’d (94.4%) during the past six months and, despite its global prominence, fewer participants (58.3%) have recently used Grindr. Besides 
Jack’d and Grindr, 11.7% of participants have recently used other 
MSM apps, chiefly Hornet (6.1%), Growlr (1.4%), Zank (0.9%), and Blued (0.9%). Regarding self-exposure, 62.4% of participants reported having at least one picture clearly revealing their face, while 75.1% of participants reporte d either being fully clothed or 
not displaying their torso in any picture.

Addressing RQ1, participants’ gratifications sought from MSM 
apps was ranked by the percentages of important or very 
important endorsements (i.e., ratings > 2) were surveillance 
(87.4%), relationship (86.9%), diversion ( 71.3%), sex (52.1%), 
and social (50.3%). As for sexual behaviors, most participants (59.6%) reported having met sexual partners through MSM apps within the past six months and 22.1% of participants reported 
having condomless anal sex with those partners. 
4.2  Relationships between Variables 
To answer RQ2, bivariate correlations were calculated to examine 
the associations between the variables (see Table 2). The 
correlation matrix indicates that frequent app-users were not necessarily longtime app-users ( r = .11, n.s.) but more likely to display a clear face picture ( r = .17, p < .05). Frequency of apps 
use is positively associated with diversion ( r = .15, p < .05), social 
(r = .20, p < .01), and relationship ( r = .21, p < .01) motives but 
has no significant relationship with sex motive ( r = .09, n.s.) or 
sexual sensation seeking ( r = .09, n.s.). A longer history of app 
use is linked to higher endorsement of diversion motive ( r = .20, p 
< .01), which is consistent with habitual media use [30], and sexual sensation seeking ( r = .14, p < .05). App-users seeking 
relationships were more likely to display a clear face picture ( r = 
.14, p < .05) while those seeking social validation ( r = .18, p < 
.01) or sexual partners ( r = .17, p < .05) were more likely to 
display a picture exposing their body. Sexual sensation seeking is positively associated with both face ( r = .14, p < .05) and body ( r 
= .26, p < .001) self-exposure.  
4.3   Regression Analyses 
To answer RQ3, hierarchical multiple regression analyses were 
performed to assess the relative influences of demographics, app 
use, the five app-use motives, sexual sensation seeking, and the interactions of motives and sexual sensation seeking in predicting 
TSP and CSP (see Table 3). Demographic variables namely age, 
race (Chinese = 1, Others = 0), education (Bachelor’s or above = 3, Some college = 2, High school or below = 1), sexual orientation (Gay/Homosexual = 1,  Others = 0), and relationship 
status (In a relationship = 1, Singl e = 0) were entered in block 1; 
app use variables in block 2; the five app-use motives and sexual 
sensation seeking in block 3; and the respective interactions 
between the five motives and sexual sensation seeking in block 4. The five motives and sexual sensation seeking were mean centered when forming the interaction term to minimize collinearity [1].  
None of the demographic variables were significant predictors of 
TSP. App-use frequency was the strongest predictor of TSP ( β = 
.25, p < .01), accounting for 8% of the variance. TSP was 
positively associated with sex motive ( β = .23, p < .01) and sexual 
sensation seeking ( β = .17, p < .05), and negatively associated with surveillance motive ( β = -.15, p < .05). These variables 
entered in block 3 explained an additional 8% of the variance in 
TSP. In block 4, the interaction between diversion motive and sexual sensation seeking ( β = .17, p < .05), and the interaction 
between sex motive and sexual sensation seeking ( β = .18, p < 
.05) predicted TSP. This explained an additional 5% of its variance. The hierarchical regres sion model explained 21% of the 
variance in TSP. 
The sexual orientation variable (Gay/Homosexual = 1, Others = 
0) emerged as a significant negative predictor of CSP ( β = -.16, p 
< .05) which indicated that non-gay identified MSM app-users were likely to report more CSP, accounting for 2% of its variance. 
Apps use, app-use motives, and sexual sensation seeking were not 
significantly related to CSP. In block 4, CSP was predicted by the interaction between diversion motive and sexual sensation seeking (β = .19, p < .05), and the interaction between sex motive 
and sexual sensation seeking ( β = .18, p < .05), constituting an 
additional 7% of the variance. The hierarchical regression model 
explained 15% of the variance in CSP.

4.4  Interactive Relationships 
To answer RQ4, a series of simple slope analysis [1] were 
conducted to probe the interactive effects on TSP and CSP of sex 
motive and sexual sensation seeking (see Figures 1 and 2), and 
diversion motive and sexual sensation seeking (see Figures 3 and 4).  
Among app-users with higher endorsements of sex motive ( SD > 
1), those with higher ratings of sexual sensation seeking tended to 
report more TSP, r = .66, p < .001, and CSP, r = .42, p < .001. For 
app-users with lower endorsements of sex motive ( SD < 1), there were no significant differences in  the relationship between sexual 
sensation seeking and TSP, r = -.03, n.s., or between sexual 
sensation seeking and CSP, r = -.06, n.s. 
Similarly, among app-users wi th higher endorsements of 
diversion motive ( SD > 1), those with higher ratings of sexual 
sensation seeking tended to report more TSP, r = .66, p < .001, 
and CSP, r = .41, p < .001. For app-users with lower 
endorsements of diversion motive ( SD < 1), there were no 
significant differences in the relationship between sexual sensation seeking and TSP, r = -.04, n.s., or between sexual 
sensation seeking and CSP, r = -.07, n.s.

The present study contributes to a more precise understanding of why and how MSM are using social networking mobile apps, and informs the theoretical debate concerning the impact of social networking technology on sexual risk behaviors. Specifically, we 
identified the relative importance of multiple app-use motives 
(including, but not limited to, fi nding sexual partners), examined 
the extent to which these app-use motives and sexual sensation seeking relate to patterns of app use, and differentiated among factors contributing to sexual partnering via apps. 
Our results challenge the premise that the primary motive for 
using MSM apps is to find sexual partners and that this motive drives sexual partnering via apps, increasing risky sexual behaviors [cf. 40]. For most MSM app-users, finding sex partners was not the most important gratification sought. Checking out other MSM nearby (surveillance) and looking for romantic or 
platonic partners (relationship) came first, followed by escaping 
from boredom or work (diversion), before finding sexual partners (sex) and seeking peer validation (social). Additionally, the sex motive did not contribute to history or frequency of app use. Longtime app-users were more likely to endorse diversion motive while frequent users were more likely to endorse relationship, 
social, and diversion motives. To be sure, sex motive and sexual 
sensation seeking were independent predictors of TSP. But app-use frequency was a stronger independent predictor of TSP even though it had no significant relationship with sex motive or sexual sensation seeking. Although sex motive and sexual sensation seeking were significantly correlated with CSP, none of these bivariate correlations held up in the hierarchical multiple 
regression model.  
According to Cooper and colleagues, people’s motives for sex and 
risky behaviors may be driven by desires to escape or pleasure that are focused on either the self or others [10]; in addition, sexual motives are highly dependent on relational context and 
partner’s motives [9]. The finding that app-use frequency 
predicted TSP despite the lack of significant associations with sex motive and sexual sensation seeking suggests that sex gratification sought neither predetermines, nor is a necessary condition for, sexual partnering via apps. The hierarchical multiple regression model attests to this and indicates that MSM 
app-users with higher endorsements of surveillance motive tended 
to report fewer TSP. Surveillance gratification relates to the need to know what is going on around one’s environment and influences one’s social risk perception [36]. It may be that app-users who endorse such needs may be more cautious and selective in arranging sexual encounters via apps, thereby resulting in 
fewer TSP.  
The present study underscores the interplay between sensation 
seeking and gratifications sought in relation to sexual partnering via apps. Our results indicate that sexual sensation seeking intervenes in the relationship between gratification sought and 
sexual partnering when the type of gratification sought is sex or 
diversion. While sex motive and sexual sensation seeking 
predicted TSP, both as independent  variables and as interaction 
terms, they were only able to predict CSP as interaction terms. This finding suggests that the app-use motive of finding sexual partners may indeed result in having more app-met sexual partners, but not necessarily more condomless ones, unless it is 
accompanied by high sexual sensation seeking.  
Another similar pattern of interactive effect, which is interesting 
and less expected, was between diversion motive and sexual 
6 of 9sensation seeking. While diversion motive was not a significant 
independent predictor of TSP or  CSP, a high diversion motive 
combined with high sexual sensation seeking predicted both TSP and CSP. It appears that the propensity of MSM with high sexual sensation seeking to prefer ex citing and novel sexual stimulation 
[19] is synergistic with their diversionary app-use motive to 
escape from the constraints of routine and the problems associated 
with everyday life [34].  
Taken together, our results suggest that sexual risk-taking with 
app-met partners is more likely to occur among MSM with the predisposition for sexual sensation seeking and whose app use is driven by gratifications that complement the underlying desire for 
exciting and novel experiences. These findings appear to lend 
support to the self-selection hypothesis that individuals who practice riskier behavior are drawn to such technologies. 
Conversely, we found no evidence for the accentuation hypothesis that app use promotes riskier sexual behavior. While app-use frequency predicted more TSP, neither app-use frequency nor history were significant predictors of CSP. These observations, 
however, do not amount to causal inferences owing to the cross-
sectional nature of our data.  
5.1  Practical Implications 
The present study has several practical implications for policy makers, health educators, and MSM counselors. For policy makers, our results address public health concerns about the impact of app use on risky sexual behaviors among MSM. While the frequent use of MSM apps may facilitate sexual partnering, it does not affect condomless behaviors—not even among those 
whose motive for using MSM apps is to find sexual partners 
unless they also possess a strong pr opensity to prefer exciting and 
novel sexual stimulation.   
For health educators, our findings regarding the characteristics 
and motives of MSM app-users can inform the design of more 
effective sexual health intervention programs delivered through social networking platforms. That social gratification sought stood 
out as the only motive variable with a significant positive association with all other app-use motives suggests that it is a common underlying motive for app use. Health educators may be able to attract and engage with a large segment of MSM app-users 
by appealing to their social inclusion and validation needs. Online 
intervention programs could incor porate personality quizzes that 
enable participants to gauge their popularity in the community 
and which participants can share on their social media accounts.   
For MSM counselors, our results suggest that they should not take 
the presence or absence of sex gr atification sought from apps at 
its face value when making risk assessments. Counselors should also pay greater attention to non-gay identified MSM app-users considering our finding that they may be more likely to report condomless sex with app-met partners.  
5.2  Limitations and Directions for Further Research 
A major limitation of the present study is the cross-sectional study design, which restricts our ability  to make temporal assessments 
and causal inferences. Future work could adopt a longitudinal study of new app-users to (a) compare the numbers of TSP and 
CSP when users begin using the apps and at regular intervals 
thereafter, and (b) capture any fluctuation in the frequency of use and the perceived importance of th e different types of apps-use 
motives since the beginning of apps use.  In addition, the present study did not consider other means of 
meeting sexual partners and is, therefore, unable to assess the 
comparative rates of sexual partnering and condomless anal sex partners. Beyond comparisons of sexual behaviors, future studies should examine the extent to which social networking mobile apps serve as a functional alternative to more traditional means of making social connections. Considering that MSM apps have 
been lauded as the modern-day gay bar [28], more research is 
needed to understand whether app use complement or substitute for how MSM’s needs are met within their physical environments.
