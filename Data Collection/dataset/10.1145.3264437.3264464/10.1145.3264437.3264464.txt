1 Introduction  
Analyzing  theoretical sources  of effective cryptosystem  
mathematical models construction we insist on using d ifficult 
mathematical problems which the solution demands from 
illegal user to have large computer resources  volumes.  
According to Shann on [1], these problems include 
“Diophantine difficulties”. Using “Diop hantine difficulties” 
prevents reduction  of the set of iterated keys.  
As it is  known [2, 3], the Diophantine equation is the 
polynomial equation of the form:   
𝒇(𝒙𝟏,𝒙𝟐,...,𝒙𝒏) = 𝟎, (1) 
 
with integer coefficients. Solutions should  also be found in 
integers or non -negative integers. The issue of solving the 
Diophantine equation is to find integer solutions or to prove 
that there is no such so lution . 
Hilbert's tenth problem was formulated  in 1900 . The main 
aim was to find ge neral algorithm for solving any  Diophantine 
equation. In 1970 Yuri Vladimirovich Matiyasevich solved the 
problem and proved impossibility of the solution . The absence 
of general algorithm for solving any given Diophantine 
equation is guaranteed as it appears fro m this solution. This 
seriously impedes the solution of  some Diophantine equation 
without any additional information about solutions.   
Today, the us e of Diophantine equations for developing 
Information secure systems has becom e widely spread  [11, 
12.13]. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the possibility 
of using even the simplest Diophantine equations to develop 
sufficiently resistant to hack information security systems.  
2 The Method Of Solving The Linear 
Inhomogeneous Diophantine Equation  
We consider linear Diophantine equations:  
 
∑𝒂𝒊𝒎
𝒊=𝟏∙𝒙𝒊=𝒄, (2) 
 
where 𝑨=(𝒂𝟏,…𝒂𝒎),𝒄,𝒎 – integer, 𝒎≥𝟐. 
The following statements are true for this equation:  
1. If the greatest common divisor of 𝒂𝒊,𝒊=𝟏,𝟐,…,𝒎  is 
not a divisor of 𝒄 then equation (2) is unsolvable in 
integers.  
2. The opposite is true, if the greatest common divisor of 
𝒂𝒊,𝒊=𝟏,𝟐,…,𝒎  is a divisor of 𝒄 then equation (2) is 
solvable in integers as it has an infinite number of 
solutions.  
There fore, if the greatest common divisor of 𝒂𝒊,𝒊=
𝟏,𝟐,…,𝒎  is 1, i.e. 𝐚𝐢,𝐢=𝟏,𝟐,…,𝐦 is coprime, then 
equation (2) is always solvable in integers.  This creates  the 
possibility to use the equation (2) to develop mathematical 
model of the simplest Inf ormation Secure System when its 
coefficients 𝒂𝒊,𝒊=𝟏,𝟐,…,𝒎  are coprime. That means that 
the existence of solutions is guaranteed.  
We first define the module vector  𝑵=(𝒏𝟏,…,𝒏𝒎),𝒎≥
𝟐  that satisfies the following conditions:  
1. ∀𝒋,   𝒋∈[𝟏,𝒎] 𝒏𝒋<∑𝒂𝒊𝒎
𝒊=𝟏; 
2. ∀𝒊,𝒋,𝒊≠𝒋 ,(𝒏𝒊,𝒏𝒋)=𝟏. 
We also define the variable vector 𝐁=(𝐛𝟏,…,𝐛𝐦) that 
satisfies the following condition:  Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal o r

1. ∀𝒊,𝒋,𝒊,𝒋∈[𝟏,𝒎],𝒂𝒊∙𝒃𝒋>𝒏𝒋. 
A detailed description of the parameters is presented in 
section 3.  
We calculate coefficients 𝐤𝐣𝐢 using vectors 𝑨,𝑵 and 𝑩: 
 
𝒌𝒋𝒊=𝒂𝒊∙𝒃𝒋 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒏𝒋. (3) 
 
Then equation (2) can be represented as a system:  
 
{    ∑𝐚𝐢∙𝐱𝐢∙𝐛𝟏 𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟏=𝐦
𝐢=𝟏𝐜∗𝐛𝟏𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟏
…
∑𝐚𝐢∙𝐱𝐢∙𝐛𝐦 𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝐦=𝐦
𝐢=𝟏𝐜∗𝐛𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝐦⇒ 
⇒
{    ∑𝐤𝟏𝐢∙𝐱𝐢=𝐦
𝐢=𝟏𝐜𝟏(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟏)
…
∑𝐤𝐦𝐢∙𝐱𝐢=𝐦
𝐢=𝟏𝐜𝐦(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝐦) (4) 
 
It will lead to the system:  
{    ∑𝐤𝟏𝐢∙𝐱𝐢=𝐦
𝐢=𝟏𝐜𝟏,
…
∑𝐤𝐦𝐢∙𝐱𝐢=𝐦
𝐢=𝟏𝐜𝐦. (5) 
 
This requires the following  conditions:  
 
{    ∑𝐤𝐢𝟏∙𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐧𝟏,
…
∑𝐤𝐢𝐦∙𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐧𝐦. (6) 
                    
Since 𝐤𝐢,𝐣  are fixed values, the execution of the specified 
conditions (6) will allow determin ing the valid boundary 
values of the variables 𝐱𝐢 under which the system (4) will be 
solved uniquely.  
We limit the upper right parts of the inequality system (6): 
 
{    ∑𝐤𝐢𝟏∙𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏≤𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝐢𝟏)∗∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏,
∑𝐤𝐢𝐦∙𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏≤𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝐢𝐦)∗∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏. (7) 
 
Thus, if these constraints (7) are less then 𝒏𝒋 then the original 
inequalities  will be less than the corresponding   𝐧𝐣.  
 
{    𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝐢𝟏)∗∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐧𝟏
…
𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝐢𝐦)∗∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐧𝐦⟹
{    ∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐧𝟏
𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝐢𝟏)
…
∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐧𝐦
𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝐢𝐦) (8) ⟹∑𝐱𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏<𝐦𝐢𝐧(𝐧𝐣
𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐤𝟏𝐣,…,𝐤𝐦𝐣)). 
 
The system of equations (4) under conditions (8) has a unique 
solution if the rank of the matrix 𝑲  composed of values 𝒌𝒊𝒋 is 
𝒎.  
 
𝑲=(𝒌𝟏𝟏⋯𝒌𝟏𝒎
⋮⋱⋮
𝒌𝒎𝟏⋯𝒌𝒎𝒎);  𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐠(𝑲)=𝒎. 
 
In other words, the vectors 
(k11,…,km1),…,(km1,…,kmm) are linear independent. If 
they are linear dependent, the system will not be resolved 
unambiguously.  
3 The Selection Of Vectors, Providing The 
Correct Solution Of The Linear Inhomogeneous 
Diophantine Equati on 
For the application of the developed method for solving the 
linear inhomogeneous Diophantine equation (2) to the 
modeling of the information security system, it is necessary 
that the selected vectors  𝐁=(𝐛𝟏,…,𝐛𝐦), and 𝑵=
(𝒏𝟏,…,𝒏𝒎) provide a suff iciently large value of the 
expression (8). Besides , the rank of the resulting matrix should 
be equal to 𝑚.  
Consider the possibility of constructing vectors 𝑨,𝑩,𝑵 
based on the initially defined matrix 𝑲. 
Let there be a square matrix 𝑲 with rank  𝐦 (in general it 
can be an identity matrix).  
𝑲=(𝒌𝟏𝟏⋯𝒌𝟏𝒎
⋮⋱⋮
𝒌𝒎𝟏⋯𝒌𝒎𝒎);  𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒈(𝑲)=𝒎. 
We select such different coprime modules  as 𝑵=
(𝒏𝟏,…,𝒏𝒎) so that the value of the expression (8) is greater 
than or equal to some  𝐭 . We also select the variables 𝐁=
(𝐛𝟏,…,𝐛𝐦),  so that ∀𝒋,𝒋∈[𝟏,𝒎] (𝒃𝒋,𝒏𝒋)=𝟏.  
Thus we obtain a system of equations with respect to 𝐚𝐢: 
{    𝐛𝟏∗𝐚𝟏=𝐤𝟏𝟏(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟏),
…
𝐛𝟏∗𝐚𝐦=𝐤𝟏𝐦(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟏),
…
𝐛𝐦∗𝐚𝐦=𝐤𝐦𝐦(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝐦). (9) 
 
As we can see from the system (9), each 𝒂𝒊,𝒊=𝟏,𝟐,…,𝒎 is 
calculated independently of the others. Let’s consider the 
calculation on the example of one of them. Let  this generally 
this be  𝒂𝟏. 
Consider a system consisting of 𝒎 equations.  
 
{𝒃𝟏∗𝒂𝟏=𝒌𝟏𝟏(𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒏𝟏)
…
𝒃𝒎∗𝒂𝟏=𝒌𝒎𝟏(𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒏𝒎) (10) 
 
We reduce system (10) to system of a kind:  
 
{𝒂𝟏=𝒌′𝟏𝟏(𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒏𝟏)
…
𝒂𝟏=𝒌′𝒎𝟏(𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒏𝒎) (11)A mathematical model of the cryptosystem  
based on the linear Diophantine equation  SIN '18, September 10 –12, 2018, Cardiff, United 
Kingdom  
 
Since ∀𝐣,𝐣∈[𝟏,𝐦] (𝐛𝐣,𝐧𝐣)=𝟏, it is possible.  
The system (11) is solvable, using the Chinese remainder 
theorem [8]. So we find the sought 𝐚𝟏. Similarly, other 𝐚𝐢,𝐢=
𝟏,𝟐,…,𝐦 are calculated.  
 
4 Modeling Of Information Security System 
Vase On Specified Linear Inhomogeneous 
Diopha ntine Equation  
Consider the us e of the described transformation of the linear 
inhomogeneous Diophantine equation (2) for modeling 
Information security systems both symmetric and asymmetric.  
The key generation stage is the same for both cases: the 
matrix 𝑲 of rank 𝒎 and the vector 𝑵=(𝒏𝟏,…,𝒏𝒎) so the 
value of the system (8) is greater than or equal to a certain 𝒕 – 
dimension of the space of plain texts. The space of plain texts 
is integers from half -open interval  [𝟎,..,𝒕). We also define 
vector 𝑩=(𝒃𝟏,…,𝒃𝒎), so that ∀𝒋,𝒋∈[𝟏,𝒎] (𝒃𝒋,𝒏𝒋)=𝟏. 
Vector 𝐀=(𝐚𝟏,…,𝐚𝐦) is the solution of system (10). 
Further, depending on the type of information security system, 
the vectors 𝑨,𝑩,𝑵  and matrix 𝐊 are symmetric or asymmetric 
keys.  
Symmetric information security systems use the same key 
for encryption and decryption. This key will be an integer  𝒕, 
the vectors 𝑨,𝑩,𝑵 and the matrix 𝐊 [9]. 
The scheme of symmetric information security system:  
1. Key generation.  User Alice defines encryption key 𝐝=
{𝐭,𝐀,𝐁,𝐍,𝐊} and then sends this information to user Bob 
through a secure channel (or using different symmetric 
key exchange protocols).  
2. Encryption.  Alice selects plain text 𝐌=∑𝐌𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏,𝐌∈
[𝟏,𝐭). After that calculates ciphertext 𝐂 using key 𝐝, 𝐂=
𝐄(𝐌,𝐝)=∑𝐌𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏∗𝐚𝐢. and then transmits 𝐂 to Bob.  
3. Decryption.  Bob calculates plain text 𝑴 using key 𝒅. In 
fact, the actions of Bob consist in constructing the system 
(5) on the basis of the Diophantine equation ∑𝒙𝒊𝒎
𝒊=𝟏∗
𝒂𝒊=𝑪 using vectors  𝑩,𝑵  and matrix  𝑲. The sum of the 
solutions of the system coincides with the original 
message 𝐌.   
Asymmetric encryption systems use 2 keys connected to 
each other – public and private. The public key is transmitted 
over an open (insecure) channel and is us ed to encrypt  the 
message. The secret key is used to decrypt the message [9].  
It is easy to notice that only vector 𝑨 and number 𝒕  are 
used only for encryption . And vectors 𝑩,𝑵 and matrix 𝑲 is 
used in decryption. Thus, vector 𝑨 can act as a public k ey, and 
vectors 𝑩,𝑵 and matrix 𝐊 can act as a private key.  
The scheme of asymmetric information security system:  
1. Key generation.  Alice defines public key 𝒆={𝒕,𝑨}  and 
private key  𝐝={𝑩,𝑵,𝑲} and then  transmits  public key 
to Bob through an insecure channel.  
2. Encryption.  Bob selects plain text 𝐌=∑𝐌𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏,𝐌∈
[𝟏,𝐭). After he calculates ciphertext 𝐂 using public key 𝐞, 
𝐂=𝐄(𝐌,𝐞)=∑𝐌𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏∗𝐚𝐢, and then transmits 𝐂 to 
Alice.  
3. Decryption.  Alice calculates plain text 𝑴 using private 
key 𝒅. In fact, the actions of Alice consist in constructing 
the system (5) on the basis of the Diophantine equation 
∑𝒙𝒊𝒎
𝒊=𝟏∗𝒂𝒊=𝑪 using vectors  𝑩,𝑵  and matrix  𝑲. The sum of the solutions of the system coincides with the 
original message  𝐌.  
5 The Example Of Asymmetric Information 
Security System Based On Linear 
Inhomogeneous Diophantine Equation With 
Three Variables  
Consider a simple example of Information security system, 
which is based on the linear inhomogeneous Diophantine 
equation of three variables.  
Key generation.  
We define 𝒕 = 𝟐𝟓𝟔  – dimension of the space of plain 
texts. We take an identity matrix of rank 3 as a matrix 𝐊, 
vector (𝟐𝟓𝟕,𝟐𝟔𝟑,𝟐𝟔𝟗) as a module vector 𝑵 and vector 
(𝟐,𝟑,𝟓) as a variable vector 𝑩.  
Then the system (9) looks like  this 
{        𝟐∗𝐚𝟏=𝟏(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕),
𝟐∗𝐚𝟐=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕)
𝟐∗𝐚𝟑=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕),
𝟑∗𝐚𝟏=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑),
𝟑∗𝐚𝟐=𝟏(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑),
𝟑∗𝐚𝟑=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑),
𝟓∗𝐚𝟏=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗),
𝟓∗𝐚𝟐=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗),
𝟓∗𝐚𝟑=𝟏(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗).⇒
{        𝐚𝟏=𝟏𝟐𝟗(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕),
𝐚𝟐=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕)
𝐚𝟑=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕),
𝐚𝟏=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑),
𝐚𝟐=𝟖𝟖(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑),
𝐚𝟑=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑),
𝐚𝟏=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗),
𝐚𝟐=𝟎(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗),
𝐚𝟑=𝟓𝟒(𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗). 
Using the Chinese remainder theorem [8] we obtain:  
𝐚𝟏=𝟐𝟐𝟖𝟏𝟓𝟗𝟎𝟕𝟓 ,𝐚𝟐=𝟏𝟎𝟐𝟐𝟎𝟔𝟐𝟐𝟕𝟐 ,𝐚𝟑=𝟐𝟓𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟑𝟖𝟗𝟒 . 
Thus, we have the  following  next public key – vector 𝑨=
(𝟐𝟐𝟖𝟏𝟓𝟗𝟎𝟕𝟓 ,𝟏𝟎𝟐𝟐𝟎𝟔𝟐𝟐𝟕𝟐 ,𝟐𝟓𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟑𝟖𝟗𝟒 ) and dimension 
of the space of plain texts  𝒕. 
Consider the encryption process. User Bob knows public 
key of Alice - vector 𝑨=
(𝟐𝟐𝟖𝟏𝟓𝟗𝟎𝟕𝟓 ,𝟏𝟎𝟐𝟐𝟎𝟔𝟐𝟐𝟕𝟐 ,𝟐𝟓𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟑𝟖𝟗𝟒 ) and 𝒕 = 𝟐𝟓𝟔. 
He selects the original messag e 𝒎 from the numbers on the 
segment [𝟏,𝟐𝟓𝟔] and splits it into 3 terms in an ar bitrary way 
(the terms are non -negative, including equal 0, but this will 
simplify hacking for cryptanalyst). Let 𝒎=𝟐𝟑𝟗=𝟏𝟐𝟑+
𝟕𝟏+𝟒𝟓. Then the cipher  𝒄 of the message 𝒎 is 𝐜=
𝟐𝟐𝟖𝟏𝟓𝟗𝟎𝟕𝟓 ∗𝟏𝟐𝟑+𝟏𝟎𝟐𝟐𝟎𝟔𝟐𝟐𝟕𝟐 ∗𝟕𝟏+𝟐𝟓𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟑𝟖𝟗𝟒 ∗
𝟒𝟓=𝟏𝟏𝟐𝟐𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟔𝟐𝟕𝟔𝟕   
 
Consider the decryption process. Alice gets the ciphertext 
𝐜= 𝟏𝟏𝟐𝟐𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟔𝟐𝟕𝟔𝟕  and, using the vector of variables 𝑩=
(𝟐,𝟑,𝟓) and the vector of modules 𝑵=(𝟐𝟓𝟕,𝟐𝟔𝟑,𝟐𝟔𝟗) 
calculates 𝐜𝐢,𝒊∈[𝟏..𝟑]: 
{𝐜𝟏=𝐛𝟏∗𝐜 𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟏=𝟐∗𝟏𝟏𝟐𝟐𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟔𝟐𝟕𝟔𝟕  𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟓𝟕=𝟏𝟐𝟑
𝐜𝟐=𝐛𝟐∗𝐜 𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟐=𝟑∗𝟏𝟏𝟐𝟐𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟔𝟐𝟕𝟔𝟕  𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟑=𝟕𝟏
𝐜𝟑=𝐛𝟑∗𝐜 𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝐧𝟑=𝟓∗𝟏𝟏𝟐𝟐𝟗𝟏𝟒𝟔𝟐𝟕𝟔𝟕  𝐦𝐨𝐝 𝟐𝟔𝟗=𝟒𝟓 
Thus, given the values of the matrix 𝑲, equation (2) is 
reduced to the following system of equations:  
 
{𝟏∗𝐱𝟏+𝟎∗𝐱𝟐+𝟎∗𝐱𝟑=𝟏𝟐𝟑,
𝟎∗𝐱𝟏+𝟏∗𝐱𝟐+𝟎∗𝐱𝟑=𝟕𝟏,
𝟎∗𝐱𝟏+𝟎∗𝐱𝟐+𝟏∗𝐱𝟑=𝟒𝟓, (12) 
 
which has the only solution. Alice finds the solution of this 
system (12): 
𝐱𝟏=𝟏𝟐𝟑,𝐱𝟐=𝟕𝟏,𝐱𝟑=𝟒𝟓.  
As you can see, founded terms coincide with the terms 
chosen by Bob. And their sum coincides with the original 
message 𝒎=𝟐𝟑𝟗.SIN '18, September 10 –12, 2018, Cardiff, United Kingdom  V. Osipyan, K.Litvinov  
 
6 Cryptanalysis Of The Developed System Of 
Information Protection  
Consider the cryptanalysis of the described  method. The 
cryptanalytic attempts to crack the cryptosystem He has access 
to the public key vector 𝑨=(𝒂𝟏,…𝒂𝒎) and dimension of the 
space of plain texts 𝒕, as well as the ciphertext 𝒄. Thus, the 
cryptanalytic needs to find the necessary solution of the 
Diophantine equation (2). The d iophantine equation (2) has an 
infinite set of integer solut ions, among which natural solutions 
can be limited in number, which will reduce the number of 
possible options for cryptanalyst and, accordingly, simplify 
the procedure for hacking.  
Consider this problem in the following simple example. 
Let the cryptanalyt ic has vector 𝑨 with components 𝒂𝟏=
𝟐𝟎,𝒂𝟐=𝟏𝟓,𝒂𝟑=𝟐𝟒 and ciphertext 𝐜, which form the 
following Diophantine equation:  
 
𝟐𝟎𝐱𝟏+𝟏𝟓𝐱𝟐+𝟐𝟒𝐱𝟑=𝟓𝟗 (13) 
 
The Diophantine equation (13) has the following parametric 
solution:  
 
{𝐱𝟏=𝟏−𝟑𝐭−𝟗𝐬,
𝐱𝟐=𝟏+𝟒𝐭+𝟒𝐬,
𝐱𝟑=𝟏+𝟎𝐭+𝟓𝐬, (14) 
 
It is easy to notice that the only solution (14) in natural 
numbers is 𝐱𝟏=𝟏;𝐱𝟐=𝟏;𝐱𝟑=𝟏, which will be the desired 
solution of equation (13), and, accordingly, their sum is the 
sought original message 𝒎=𝟑. Thus, one of the necessary 
conditions for the reliability of the cipher is the presence of 
several equally probable solutions in natural numbers, the 
sums of the elements of which differ. This will create 
uncertainty for cryptanalysts connected with Diop hantine 
difficulties.  
 
 
7 CONCLUSION  
We present a mathematical model of Information security 
system based on linear inhomogeneous Diophantine equation : 
∑𝐚𝐢𝐦
𝐢=𝟏∙𝐱𝐢=𝐜,  
Plain text is the solution of the Diophantine equation, 
ciphertext is the right side of the equation. We also present a 
method of finding this solution. It is based on construction of a 
system of equations that  solution  is equal to desired solution 
of the original Diophantine equation. The system of equations 
is constructed using some secret information  
Cryptanalysis of described mathematical model 
demonstrates the potential of using Diophantine equations for 
the develop ment of Information security systems despite the 
existing vulnerabilities. Using the Diophantine equations 
allows constructing the  systems that have a large variety  of 
equally probable keys. And only one key is correct.
