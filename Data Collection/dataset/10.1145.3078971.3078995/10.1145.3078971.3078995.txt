ABSTRACT
Users search for multimedia content with diﬀerent underlying moti-
vations or intentions. Study of user search intentions is an emerging
topic in information retrieval since understanding why a user is
searching for a content is crucial for satisfying the user’s need. In
this paper, we aimed at automatically recognizing a user’s intent
for image search in the early stage of a search session. We designed
seven diﬀerent search scenarios under the intent conditions of /f_ind-
ingitems, re-/f_inding items and entertainment. We collected facial
expressions, physiological responses, eye gaze and implicit user
interactions from 51 participants who performed seven diﬀerent
search tasks on a custom-built image retrieval platform. We ana-
lyzed the users’ spontaneous and explicit reactions under diﬀerent
intent conditions. Finally, we trained machine learning models
to predict users’ search intentions from the visual content of the
visited images, the user interactions and the spontaneous responses.
A/f_ter fusing the visual and user interaction features, our system
achieved the F-1 score of 0.722 for classifying three classes in a user-
independent cross-validation. We found that eye gaze and implicit
user interactions, including mouse movements and keystrokes are
the most informative features. Given that the most promising re-
sults are obtained by modalities that can be captured unobtrusively
and online, the results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such
methods for improving multimedia retrieval platforms.

A multimedia retrieval system that takes users’ intent into account
can optimize its ranking and visualization methods to be/t_ter satisfy
its users. In this context, users’ search intention has a profound
eﬀect on the way they interact with an information retrieval system.
It has been shown that search tasks are not solely performed with
the goal of information search, but also to re-/f_ind speci/f_ic content
[36] and for entertainment [ 13]. /T_he success of multimedia retrieval
does not only rely on the relevance of the content to the query and
the way the content is framed and depicted is equally important
to users, given their search intention. /T_his is more evident for the
case of multimedia retrieval in which entertainment is a major
motivator behind multimedia search [ 22]. Understanding why a
user is embarking on a multimedia search process is not possible
with information retrieval systems simply accepting query terms.
/T_herefore, search motivation shall be determined from the implicit
indicators and the context.
Due to its nature, intent in multimedia search is diﬀerent from
the classic web search intentions, i.e., informational, navigational
and transactional intentions [ 7,22]. Moshfeghi et al. [30] used
the categories of seeking information, re-/f_inding an item and two
entertainment categories to adjust arousal and mood. /T_hey fur-
ther a/t_tempted to automatically identify video search intentions
from users implicit feedback, e.g., mouse movements. /T_hey could
demonstrate the feasibility of intent recognition from users’ im-
plicit feedback. Users implicit feedback and behavioral responses
have been also used to automatically determine topical relevance
in information retrieval [1].
In this work, we aimed at automatically recognizing search intent
early in an image search session. We targeted three scenarios, i.e.,
/f_inding images, re-/f_inding images and entertainment. Our /f_inding
category includes seeking information andtransactions since we
asked the participants to identify images to be downloaded and used
for a certain purpose. /T_he re-/f_ind category is similar to the category
ofmental image proposed in [ 26] in which a user has a speci/f_ic
image in mind that they want to /f_ind. Unlike the work in [ 30], we
let the participants decide how they want to entertain themselves
through image search, thus our mood and arousal adjustments are
mixed. It is also worth noting that it is not as easy to adjust for
arousal through images in contrast to videos that are used in [30].
We recruited 51 healthy participants to participate in an experi-
ment performing image search tasks under diﬀerent intent condi-
tions. We built a custom image search interface using the Flickr1
API. Given the role of emotions in the search intent process [ 30],

we opted for recording and analyzing facial expressions and Gal-
vanic Skin Response (GSR), in addition to the interactions analyzed
in [30]. We also recorded eye gaze and pupil dilation which can
capture interaction, a/t_tention and arousal [ 5,20]. Additionally, we
recorded implicit user interactions with the search interface, includ-
ing key strokes, search logs and mouse movements. We analyzed
these modalities and how they vary under diﬀerent intent condi-
tions. Moreover, we trained models to recognize intent early in
the search session (/f_irst 30s) from the spontaneous reactions and
implicit interactions. We also used the visual content from the
visited images to recognize search intent sessions. In summary, our
major contributions are as follows.
We analyzed how facial expressions, eye gaze, queries and
implicit user interaction vary by image search intent.
We analyzed visual content features of the visited images
and demonstrate how they can be utilized for search intent
recognition.
We built and evaluated a search intent recognition system
through users spontaneous responses and interaction.
/T_hus, in contrast to the work presented in [ 30], which reported a
user-dependent intent recognition in video search, we performed a
user-independent intent recognition for image search. We also ana-
lyzed facial expressions, physiological responses, eye gaze, implicit
user interactions and visual content of images and evaluated their
eﬀectiveness for intent recognition.
Using machine learning models to predict users’ intentions from
the collected information, our system achieved the average F-1 score
of 0.722 for three classes in a user-independent cross-validation.
Furthermore, experiments revealed that eye gaze and implicit user
interactions are the most informative features. /T_his is very promis-
ing because these modalities can be captured online, which demon-
strates the potential of using such methods for improving multime-
dia retrieval platforms.
/T_he remainder of this paper is organized as follows. /T_he previous
work is presented in Section 2. /T_he experimental methodology and
apparatus are explained in Section 3. Section 4 provides details
about the image retrieval system in the experiments. Extracted
features and statistical analysis on how they vary by intent condi-
tions are reported in Section 5. Intent recognition and its results are
given in Section 6, and the limitations of this work are discussed in
Section 7. /T_he work is /f_inally concluded in Section 8.
2 BACKGROUND
/T_here is a general belief in the multimedia community that intent
in text search is diﬀerent from the intent in multimedia search [ 22].
In addition to relevance, in multimedia search, the content and the
presentation of multimedia items are also important to the user, i.e.,
why and for which purpose images and videos are taken, searched
for and viewed. User intent in the area of multimedia can in general
be divided in the domains of image and video search [22]. In each
of the two domains, several models and categories of intent have
been de/f_ined, which are conceptually similar, but named diﬀerently
in diﬀerent publications [14, 17, 24, 26].
In the image retrieval domain, the most important intent cate-
gories are navigation (/f_ind a speci/f_ic image without knowing thecontent), transaction (/f_ind a speci/f_ic image for further use), knowl-
edge orientation (learn something by looking at an image) and men-
tal image (know the content of the image beforehand) [ 26]. /T_he
following intent categories are identi/f_ied in video search: informa-
tion(obtain knowledge and gather new information), experience
learning (acquire new skills or learn something), experience exposure
(undergo a speci/f_ic experience), aﬀect (change mood or aﬀective
state) and object (the video itself as an object) [ 17]. Based on these
intent categories, several researchers tried to perform intent clas-
si/f_ication from multimedia content. Hanjalic et al. [17] classi/f_ied
videos based on shot pa/t_terns, speech and metadata into three dif-
ferent categories ( information, experience andaﬀect ) and reported a
weighted F-1 score of 0.833 for the performance of the classi/f_ication.
Lux et. al. [ 27] released and discussed an image dataset con-
taining 1,309 images for /f_ive intent classes. /T_he dataset and intent
annotations for each image were collected in a user study, and for
the intent classes, the categories presented in [ 26] were used. /T_he
intent dataset was used in [ 32] to explore if content-based visual
features can be helpful to detect the photographers’ intent (why the
picture has been taken). /T_his was done by performing unsupervised
clustering of the images into /f_ive intent classes using global visual
features. To evaluate the performance, the correlation between the
human agreement with the clusters was compared, which revealed
that content-based features can indeed be used to classify images
based on the photographers’ intent.
Moshfeghi et al. [30] studied the emotion and interaction in dif-
ferent video search intent scenarios. /T_hey recorded users’ implicit
feedback for four diﬀerent intention classes, namely, seeking infor-
mation, re-/f_inding a particular information object, entertainment by
adjusting arousal level, and entertainment by adjusting mood. /T_hey
found signi/f_icant diﬀerences between the emotional experiences of
tasks in diﬀerent intentions. /T_hey also found that the task diﬃculty
and certainty perception varied by search intention. /T_hey could
/f_inally train a model to predict search intent, in a user-dependent
cross-validation, with the accuracy of up to 57.29%.
Overall, the reviewed literature provides evidence for the use-
fulness of multimedia content and users’ spontaneous reactions
for recognizing intent in multimedia search. Nevertheless, pre-
dicting and using a user’s intent during a multimedia search is
still a rather unexplored /f_ield. Even though both content-based
methods and user interactions features have been studied in such
a context, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the /f_irst to
combine both in a multimodal fusion and to explore the usefulness
of additional modalities, i.e., eye gaze, physiological response and
facial expression.
3 DATA COLLECTION
/T_he experiment has received ethical approval from the ethical re-
view board of the faculty of psychology and educational sciences,
University of Geneva. 51 healthy participants with normal or cor-
rected to normal vision were recruited through campus wide posters
and Facebook. From these 51 participants, 18 were male and 33
were female, and the average age was 25.7 years ( σ=5:3). /T_he
participants were informed about their rights and the nature of

the experiment. /T_hey then signed an informed consent form be-
fore the recordings. /T_hey received a monetary gratitude for their
participation.
Our experiments were conducted in an acoustically isolated ex-
perimental booth with controlled lighting (shown in Figure 1). A
video was recorded using an Allied Vision2Stingray camera at 60.03
frames/second with a 780 580 resolution. Stimuli were presented
on a 23 inches screen (1920 1080), and the participants were seated
approximately 60cm from the screen. Two Litepanels3daylight spot
LED projectors were used to light up the participants’ faces to re-
duce possible shadows. An infrared block /f_ilter was mounted on the
lens to remove the re/f_lection of the infrared light from the eye gaze
tracker. Video was recorded using the Norpix Streampix so/f_tware4.
Eye gaze, pupil diameter and head distance were recorded using a
Tobii5TX300 eye gaze tracker at 300Hz. /T_he GSR was recorded us-
ing a Biopac6MP-36 at 125Hz through electrodes a/t_tached on distal
phalanges of index and middle /f_ingers. An experimental protocol
was run by Tobii Studio, and the recordings were synchronized by
a sound trigger that marked the frames before each stimulus for the
camera. /T_he same trigger was converted to a transistor/f_i/question_exclamtransistor
logic (TTL) trigger using a Brain Products StimTrak7and recorded
alongside the GSR signals.
Our participants were /f_irst familiarized with the protocol and
ratings in a test run, and then they performed search tasks under
three diﬀerent intent conditions. In this study, we were interested
in assessing knowledge emotions in image search. Knowledge
emotions are the emotions that arise as a result of the evaluation of
one’s knowledge, e.g., interest, confusion and surprise. /T_herefore,
we asked the participants to self-report these emotions on a seven-
point scale at the end of each session. In addition, we also asked
the participants to report the level of control and boredom they felt
using a similar seven-point scale rating.

demic research8. For the face videos, we provide the landmarks,
features and action units for the bene/f_it of the community.

4 IMAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
To conduct the search experiments, we created our own custom
image search tool. A snapshot of our image retrieval system is
shown in Figure 2. /T_he design of the tool was made in a way that
it could easily be customized to the diﬀerent search intents. /T_he
images are retrieved using the Flickr API. When the user performs
a search by submi/t_ting a query, the tool returns a ranked list of
images. /T_he images are presented to the user in an image gallery
depicting the /f_irst ten images as thumbnails with the /f_irst image
enlarged at the bo/t_tom.
/T_he experiments were conducted in seven sessions, under three
intent conditions, namely, entertainment, /f_inding andre-/f_inding
items. Each session lasted three minutes and sessions were pre-
sented in random order. We had three sessions for /f_inding images
for a speci/f_ic purpose; three sessions for re-/f_inding images that
were displayed for 15 seconds before the search session and one
free viewing entertainment session. For two search sessions, one in
/f_inding and one in re-/f_inding, we slightly modi/f_ied the search terms
on the /f_ly to observe the eﬀect of goal obstruction on users behavior.
/T_he modi/f_ication was performed by adding and removing random
query terms before they were sent to Flickr. /T_he search tasks were
mostly about Geneva where the experiments were conducted. /T_he
image search task instructions are given in Table 1.
We discarded the data from the participants who misunderstood
the instructions, and the sessions in which the majority of eye gaze
samples were lost (due to extreme head pose and, in one case, device
failure). /T_herefore, out of 357 possible search sessions, we could
analyze 299 session that were consistently and correctly performed
and recorded. In the analysis of behavioral responses, the data from
the /f_irst seven participants were also discarded since we made a
small change in the layout of the interface, a/f_ter recording them,
which made the eye gaze responses inconsistent.

the analysis in this section, we analyzed user interactions features
extracted from the full sessions. /T_he visual content features and
the user interactions features from the /f_irst 30 seconds were used
for the intent recognition in Section 6.
5.1.1 Implicit user interaction. All implicit user interactions per-
formed with the search tool were logged (see Table 2). /T_his includes
the clicks, mouse movements, displayed images and thumbnails,
selected images, search queries and keystrokes. Additionally, we
implemented the possibility to manipulate search queries in the
background. All the information was collected using Java scripts
and stored in a MySQL server using PHP for later analysis. From the
collected data, we extracted diﬀerent types of features for further
analysis, including mouse movements, mouse clicks and keystrokes.
5.1.2 Eye gaze. Optical eye gaze trackers track the direction of
gaze and provide the projected gaze. /T_he eye gaze pa/t_tern and pupil
diameter have been used for detecting boredom, mind-wanderingTable 3: /T_he list of 60 eye gaze features. /T_he functionals
or statistical descriptives are mean, standard deviation, /f_irst
and third quartiles, median, maximum and minimum.
Feature type Description #
AOI Number of /f_ixations in the AOI, the proportion
of gaze duration in AOI2
Fixation Number of /f_ixations, statistical descriptives on
/f_ixation duration8
Saccade Number of saccedes, statistical descriptives of
saccade duration, absolute and relative saccadic
directions22
Scan path Statistical descriptives of scan path distances and
their speed14
and interest [ 3,11,20,25]. Eye gaze trackers o/f_ten record head
distance and pupil diameter which are both shown to be useful
for recognizing aﬀective and cognitive states [ 20]. Head distance
is a measure of body posture. Pupillary re/f_lex is modulated by
emotional arousal through increase in sympathetic activities [ 5].
Eye gaze features such as /f_ixations and saccades were extracted
by the eye gaze analysis so/f_tware (Tobii Studio). Fixations are the
points where eye gaze is maintained in the same location for a min-
imum amount of time (around 100ms). /T_he number of eye /f_ixations,
the presence of eye gaze in the area of interest (AOI) and the sac-
cadic movements vary in diﬀerent cognitive and emotional states.
Saccades are the eye movements between /f_ixations. /T_he absolute
direction of saccades (measured by their absolute angle) and the
relative direction with regard to the last saccade were calculated
by Tobii studio. With a simplifying assumption of straight saccadic
movements, we de/f_ined the scan path as the direct path between
the consecutive /f_ixations. In eye gaze analysis, an area of interest
is o/f_ten de/f_ined to study the gaze pa/t_tern locally. We de/f_ined the
area of the enlarged image as the AOI. Inspired by the relevant
literature [ 3,11], 60 features were extracted from eye gaze, pupil
diameter and head distance (see Table 3).
5.1.3 Facial expressions. Facial expressions were analyzed using
the Aﬀdex SDK [ 28]. /T_he Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [ 12]
is a taxonomy of facial movements that can describe facial expres-
sions, e.g., lip puller, brow raise and dimpler. /T_he intensity of 19
facial action units were detected at frame level by Aﬀdex. Addition-
ally, head pose direction was also extracted. /T_he following seven
functionals were applied to the features in each session for pooling:
mean, standard deviation, median, maximum, minimum, /f_irst and
third quartiles. /T_his resulted in a feature vector with 154 elements
for each session.
5.1.4 Galvanic skin response (GSR). GSR is a measurement of
electrical conductance on skin through a pair of electrodes. /T_he
skin’s electrical resistance measured by GSR /f_luctuates with the
activity of sweat glands which are driven by the sympathetic ner-
vous system. GSR responses consists of tonic (slow) and phasic
(fast and o/f_ten event-related) responses. GSR varies by emotional
arousal and has been extensively used in emotion sensing [ 8,23].
GSR provides a measure for detecting the presence and intensity of
emotions. We used the open source TEAP toolbox9[34] to extract
nine features from the GSR signals. In order to capture the phasic

calculated their frequency of occurrence, amplitude and rise time.
Statistical descriptives were also extracted that captures both tonic
and phasic characteristics of electrodermal responses. /T_he list of
features are given in Table 4.
5.2 Visual content features
To explore how the content of the visited images are related to the
intent categories, we extracted three sets of visual content features
from the images. We decided to use one feature-set that extracts the
overall visual similarities based on colors and textures in images
visited for the same intent and another set that is able to emulate
the visual perception of a human to explore if the visited images in
intent classes are of diﬀerentiable nature according to their visual
perception. Additionally, sentiment expressed by images, i.e., visual
sentiment [ 4], may carry information about the intent categories
that can be useful. For each of these three feature-sets, we created
one feature vector containing the visual features of all images visited
in the /f_irst 10, 20 and 30 seconds of the search session for each
search task. /T_he visual content features were only used for the
intent recognition experiments in Section 6. We decided not to
directly use features extracted from a deep convolutional neural
network trained on Imagenet [ 10] since such features are related
to the concepts present in images that can be associated with the
speci/f_ic tasks rather than intentions.
5.2.1 Joint composite descriptor (JCD). JCD is a set of global
visual features that represent the texture and color of an image.
/T_he JDC features are joint descriptors, which combine two compact
composite descriptors (fuzzy color and texture histogram and the
color and edge directivity) in one. /T_he combination of the two
descriptors is possible because their color information originates
from the same fuzzy color system. /T_he result of the combination
is a descriptor, which contains fuzzy color information, texture
information and edge information [ 9]. By extracting this feature,
we wanted to study the visual similarities in images visited in the
same intent condition.
5.2.2 Tamura. /T_he Tamura features are de/f_ined based on the
assumption that textural features correspond to the perception
of the human eyes [ 35]. Tamura compared coarseness, contrast,
directionality, line-likeness, regularity and roughness, which are
six diﬀerent texture features, with psychological measures taken
from experiment subjects. /T_he three features that achieved the best
results in his evaluation are coarseness, contrast and orientation.
Coarseness measures the size texture primitives (also called textureelements or texels) [ 18]. Larger textures have larger primitives
and /f_ine textures have smaller ones. /T_he contrast measures how
distinctive the diﬀerences between the textures in the images are.
/T_he contrast can be considered as clear to identify if all areas can
easily be distinguished from each other. /T_he orientation describes
the dominant orientation of the textures in the image. A single
image can have only one dominant orientation or several of them.
Moreover, an image can also have no orientation at all, which then
is called isotropic. For the Tamura global image feature, coarseness,
contrast and orientation are extracted from an image and stored
in a histogram representation [ 19]. Using this feature, we want to
explore if the intent classes are related to the visual perception and
if this can help to classify the intent class.
5.2.3 Visual sentiment descriptors. A visual sentiment concept
detector [ 21] was applied to the images that were visited during
the search process. /T_his sentiment detector was trained to detect
a re/f_ined set of a large-scale visual sentiment concept ontology
(VSO) that detects the presence of adjective-noun pairs in images.
/T_hese adjective-noun pairs (ANP) were selected from social media
data based on their relevance in expressing sentiment. /T_he model
that we used is an improved version of the original work [ 4] that
uses a residual deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that is
trained to detect adjectives, nouns and ANPs simultaneously [ 21].
/T_his CNN generates probability estimates (so/f_tmax output) for 553
adjective-noun pairs that are then combined for the visited images
to form feature vectors.
5.3 Statistical analysis
In this Section, we analyze how the features extracted from behav-
ior, reported emotions and interactions diﬀer under diﬀerent intent
scenarios. Participants self-reported a set of emotions, e.g., interest,
boredom and confusion, at the end of each short search session.
We calculated the Spearman rank correlation between all the self-
reported emotions (see Table 5). As expected, interest and boredom
are inversely correlated. /T_he signi/f_icant correlation between sur-
prise and confusion ratings demonstrate that these emotions were
co-occurring in search scenarios. We further looked into whether

the reported emotions varied in diﬀerent intent conditions. We per-

non-manipulated situations which demonstrated that our query
manipulation was too weak and not eﬀective in inducing the sense
of goal obstruction.
Semantic complexity of a term is associated with its ambiguity,
i.e., the number of diﬀerent meanings that can be interpreted from
the word. We calculated the query complexity using a synset tree;
the deeper the vertex is in the tree the less ambiguous the term
is [29]. /T_he total complexity is calculated as follows. First, we get
the synset tree for a given search term. In the tree, we iterate over
all branches leading to the term. For all branches, we calculate the
depth and sum it. /T_he number and depth of branches is represen-
tative of the number of the meaning that can be derived and is a
measure of complexity. For example, “cage” has three branches in
the sysnet tree and each of them has a depth of one which makes its
complexity score three. A one-way ANOVA test on the query term
complexity showed a signi/f_icant diﬀerence between diﬀerent intent
conditions. /T_he entertainment condition queries had a much lower
complexity compared to the /f_inding andre-/f_inding conditions. /T_he
re-/f_inding condition had the highest complexity where the partici-
pants were trying to use generic terms describing the content they
had in mind. /T_hrough /f_i/t_ting a linear model, we checked whether
the complexity of the query terms varied over time. We found that,
only in the re-/f_inding condition, there was a signi/f_icant increase in
the complexity of the query terms ( slope=0:05,p=0:00).We also looked at the number of search terms used in each
condition. A one-way ANOVA test showed signi/f_icant diﬀerences
between the number of query terms used in average ( p=0:00,F=
17:75). Similarly, the entertainment condition had the lowest av-
erage number of query terms followed by /f_inding andre-/f_inding
conditions (see Figure 4).
To study the browsing pa/t_tern, we counted the number of browsed
images per session. A one-way ANOVA test found a signi/f_icant
diﬀerence between the number of images displayed under three
diﬀerent conditions ( p=0:00,F=5:68). Given the smaller number
of query terms used in the entertainment condition, this demon-
strates that the participants spent more time browsing rather than
searching (see Figure 4).
We looked into two features from mouse movements under dif-
ferent intent conditions. /T_he speed and the distance of mouse
movement trajectories. A one-way ANOVA test showed signif-
icant diﬀerences for speech ( p=0:00,F=6:77) and distance
(p=0:01,F=5:12) under diﬀerent intent conditions. Mouse move-
ment was the fastest in the entertainment condition. However, the
distance of the mouse trajectories was much shorter in average
compared the /f_inding andre-/f_inding conditions. /T_herefore, partici-
pants spent less time exploring the interface with their mouse in
theentertainment condition.
Mouse click features describe where on the interface the clicks
occurred and at what time. We collected clicks based on the loca-
tions of the clicks, which are arrowright andarrowle/f_t, imagemarked
(enlarged image), pager (to change pages), search andthumbgallery
(thumbnails). /T_he distribution of the click frequencies is shown in
Figure 3. A one-way ANOVA test showed signi/f_icant diﬀerences
between click frequencies for imagemarked (p=0:00,F=22:66),
pager (p=0:00,F=6:63),search bu/t_ton ( p=0:00,F=7:00) and
thumbgallery (p=0:00,F=43:78). We also calculated the key
stroke rates and found that the rate of key strokes were not diﬀerent
under the three intent conditions.
/T_he aggregated heat maps of eye gaze on three diﬀerent condi-
tions are given in Figure 5. We can observe that users spent more
time looking at the enlarged image in the entertainment conditions
whereas they spent much less time in the re-/f_inding condition. In

the re-/f_ind condition, the goal was to spot the image so they spent
more time on queries and exploring the thumbnails.
Using the Aﬀdex SDK [ 28], we also calculated the intensity of
the following expressed emotions: sadness, joy, disgust, anger,
contempt , surprise and engagement. /T_he statistical analysis did
not show any diﬀerence between the frequency of the expressed
emotions under diﬀerent conditions.
6 INTENT RECOGNITION
Predicting the search intent early on in a search session can help
a retrieval system to adapt its results according to the user’s need.
/T_herefore, we a/t_tempted recognizing search intent from four diﬀer-
ent modalities, namely, facial expressions, physiological responses,
eye gaze and implicit interactions, e.g., mouse movement. Inspired
by the previous work that related visual content to the possible
search intent [ 17,26], we also extracted visual content features
from the visited images and used them for intent recognition. We
only extracted features from the /f_irst 10, 20 and 30 seconds of a
search session to imitate a situation in which a retrieval system is
predicting the search intent.
Using the extracted features from the /f_irst 10, 20 and 30 seconds,
we trained Random Forest classi/f_iers to tackle the classi/f_ication.
We opted for using an ensemble method due to its ability to per-
form well with lower number of samples and its robustness against
over-/f_i/t_ting. /T_he utilized features are described in Section 5. /T_he
performance of the classi/f_ication was evaluated through a user-
independent cross-validation, in which the samples from the same
participants were never present in both train and test sets.
6.1 Experimental results and multimodal
fusion
For all our classi/f_ication experiments, we used the same Random
Forest classi/f_ier with the respective features as input [ 6] with the
following parameters: 300 trees, 100 iterations, unlimited maximal
depth and a batch size of 100.
For the evaluation, we used user-independent cross-validation.
Table 6 gives an overview of the classi/f_ication results using the user
interaction features, visual content features and fusions of them.
We fused the modalities in two ways.
/T_he /f_irst fusion method is early fusion which consists in concate-
nating diﬀerent feature vectors into a single vector before being fed
to a classi/f_ier. A problem with early fusion is that the combination
of very diverse features, like user interaction features with visualfeatures, can pose problems. For example, combining interaction
features with a small number of dimensions with a visual feature-
set with many thousand dimensions in an early fusion does not
result to improved performance [16, 33].
/T_he second utilized fusion method is late fusion. In late fusion
or decision-level fusion, each modality has its own classi/f_ier. A/f_ter
these /f_irst classi/f_ication steps, the output of all classi/f_iers are com-
bined to obtain a /f_inal result. /T_his combination can be performed
for example by simple majority vote, using another classi/f_ier or
weighted sum of the scores. Because each feature is processed in a
separate classi/f_ier, late fusion is more costly in terms of computa-
tional complexity. /T_he choice of late fusion method depends on the
dataset, the features and the metrics that are used to calculate the
distances between the diﬀerent features [15].
As shown in Table 6, the visual content features alone outperform
the baseline, which we calculated using the ZeroR classi/f_ier. ZeroR
assigns the label from the majority class to all the instances and
provides a baseline. /T_his is an indicator that the intent categories are
somehow preserved in the visual features but single features are not
very eﬃcient to detect this. /T_he same is true for all user interactions
features. /T_he performance of Tamura is particularly interesting
since it should be able to give a similar perception to humans and
indicates that diﬀerent intent classes are perceived diﬀerently. /T_he
VSO features performed the best among the visual features. VSO
features also performed be/t_ter with more images, i.e., the longer
the interaction window we analyzed. However, VSO features might
have captured the concepts that are related to the tasks rather than
intentions. Comparing visual content features and user interactions
features, the user spontaneous and implicit interaction features
perform be/t_ter. Implicit interaction outperforms the visual content
features. All sets of visual content features perform be/t_ter than the
face and GSR features.
Looking at the window length, the shorter segments yield be/t_ter
results for behavioral and interaction features whereas for content
features longer segments mostly increased the performance. Over-
all, 30 seconds segments gives the best performance with late fusion
reaching average F-1 score of 0.722 for three classes.
Early fusion does not lead to a large increase of the performance
and for the user interactions features it even leads to a small de-
crease. Feature vectors from diﬀerent modalities are of diﬀerent size
and simply concatenating them does not yield superior results (for
example face compared to GSR). For the visual content features, the
early fusion lead to a small increase, which was expected based on
previous /f_indings [ 16,33]. Late fusion for all diﬀerent combinations

7 DISCUSSIONS
/T_he intention categories in this work do not cover all possible search
intent scenarios and are only three typical cases. To fully cover
the whole spectrum of search intent, we need a /f_iner granularity
and additional intent categories speci/f_ic to the image content. We
did not witness signi/f_icant emotional expressions, and this could
be a result of the mental fatigue caused by the experiment or the
arti/f_icial nature of the search tasks with less sense of ownership
than genuine ones [31].
Another limitation of this work is the potential bias of the tasks
cognitive load and behavioral responses elicited by instructions
rather than intention. /T_his might have resulted in diﬀerent inter-
action and behavioral responses that are not necessarily related to
intent. For example, the head pose or eye gaze position are more
likely to be at the top to recall the task description in more diﬃcult
tasks compared to the easy one, i.e., entertainment.
/T_he visual features used in this work show promising results.
Nevertheless, further analysis is needed on content-based features.
We hypothesize that emotional content of the query and retrieved
results are related with search intent, e.g., positive sentiment might
be associated with entertainment intent. However, what has been
detected by visual sentiment features might not necessarily be
related the intention, and the diﬀerence in the visual sentiment
might be the result of the task at hand.
/T_he intent recognition performance is similar to the one reported
in [30], i.e., 51.4% in the early stage for four classes. However,
our results are obtained using a user-independent cross-validation
which is more generalizable and shows robustness to between-user
variations. Nevertheless the performance of such a system shall befurther evaluated in an operationalized system with a diverse set
of scenarios in which intention can even change in the middle of a
search session.
To the best of our knowledge, the relevance of the content to
search intent has not been analyzed in text-content. Utilizing the
language processing models to understand queries and retrieved
content can be also useful for determining users search intent.
8 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we analyzed the spontaneous responses of users un-
der diﬀerent search intent conditions. We found that implicit user
interaction including mouse movement to be the most informative
channel of information for predicting the intent. Eye gaze behavior
also showed promising power in diﬀerentiating between diﬀerent
intent conditions. However, despite the importance of emotions
in the search process [ 30], facial expression and physiological re-
sponses underperformed in recognizing search intent compared
to implicit user interactions. As we showed, the visual content
of the browsed images can also provide hints on the underlying
intention for image search. To summarize, we identi/f_ied the best
modalities for recognizing search intent and showed the feasibility
of automatically identifying search intent early in a search session.
If such automatic intent recognition method is deployed, the re-
sulting intent-aware multimedia retrieval system can optimize its
results by switching its ranking methods according to the user’s
underlying motivation.
