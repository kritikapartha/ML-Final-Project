ABSTRACT  
Despite more than a decade of efforts to broaden participation in 
computing, Native students and girls are alarmingly 
underrepresented in computer science (CS) education. 
Addressing the disparities in access to rigorous, college 
preparatory CS education in  Native communities requires tribe -
specific culturally relevant and revitalizing pedagogical and 
curricular approaches. This panel highlights the work of Native 
computing educators to center, celebrate, and connect Native 
students’ and girls’ tribe -specifi c culture and languages to 
fundamental computing concepts and applications.

1 SUMMARY  
Despite recent initiatives designed to broaden participation in 
computing such as CS4All, disparities in access to computer 
science education for Native American students and girls remain 
alarmingly steep. Although Native American, Alaskan Native, 
and Native Hawaiian students combined comprise 1.4% of the 
preK-12 public school student population [13], they took just

4% of the AP CS A exams and just 0.6% of the AP CS Principle 
(AP CS P) exams in 2020 [4]. In that same year, only 272 Native 
girls took any AP CS exam, comprising just 0.02% of AP CS A 
test takers and 0.2% of AP CS P test takers [4]. The lack of access 
to rigorous, college preparatory AP CS exams points to broader 
disparities in STEM course access and structural and 
psychosocial barriers to STEM education for underrepresented 
students of color, including Native students [10, US. Dept. of 
Education, 2014). Less than half of Native American and Alaskan 
Native students have access to a full complement of math and 
science courses in their high school [12], an important barrier to 
computing education given that students are often required to 
take and pass Algebra I before taking an AP CS course [5]. 
Native students also face steep barriers to access to technology 
in the home, including internet services [2], and psychosocial 
barriers to STEM and computing specific to their tribal and 
gender identities [7]. As a result of cumulative, overlapping, and 
mutually reinforcing barriers, very few Native women obtain 
Bachelor’s computing degrees (0.08%, [8]). Only one Native 
woman earned a Doctorate in Computer Science in 2018 [9].  
Although the literature about Native girls in computing 
education is sparse, literature about girls of color (Black, Latinx, 
and Native America/Hawaiian/Alaskan) and other 
underrepresented groups in computing suggests that girls of 
color benefit from culturally relevant [1, 6] curricular and 
pedagogical approaches that: empower them to become social 
change agents [3]; reflect upon and question and/or challenge 
existing structural forms of exclusion from computing [3]; 
develop a sense of accountability to the shared or communal 
goals [11]; and consider challenging stereotypes and their own 
limits as a motivator rather than a hindrance to their success in 
computing pathways [11]. Culturally revitalizing pedagogical 
and curricular approaches to girl-focused computing education 
would seek to do all of this within a framework which centers, 
celebrates, and connects Native stud ents’ tribe -specific culture 
and languages to fundamental computing concepts and 
applications. 
This panel convenes Native computing educators from 
different tribal cultures and backgrounds to discuss their 
experiences in co-developing and supporting the implementation 
of tribe-specific culturally relevant and revitalizing CS curricula 
for Native students and girls. In the wake of the devastating toll 
that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on Native elders,

1057language and culture bearers, and communities, this is an urgent 
and relevant topic for all students, faculty, and tech industry 
workers. The panelists occupy a wide range of roles in the 
computing education ecosystem, including STEM/CS out- of-
school time programming, preK-12 CS courses in Native-serving 
schools, higher education recruitment programs, and computer 
science education research.  
2 PANEL STRUCTURE  
The moderator will open by presenting the context for the 
discussion, highlighting current data and trends on the 
participation and persistence of Native students and girls across 
the computing ecosystem, and then introducing each panelist. 
Each panelist will be given 10 minutes to describe their 
experiences in developing tribe-specific culturally relevant 
and/or revitalizing curricular and pedagogical approaches to 
their work and explore how their work can inform the broader 
computer science education community. The moderator will 
then invite and facilitate a discussion with the audience around 
their interest in working with and within Native communities to 
incorporate indigenous languages and culture in CS education.

Ian Her Many Horses (Sicangu Lakota) grew up on the 
Rosebud Reservation and is a graduate of Todd County High 
School and the University of Colorado at Boulder (B.S. Compute r 
Science, Math Ed. Certification, PhD Computer Science 
Education). He has taught Math and Computer Science in the 
past at Todd County HS, as well as worked for CU-Boulder as

are on PreK-12th grade curriculum that infuses cultural 
frameworks, specifically geared toward Native American 
students. Currently she is working on cultural revitalization curriculum that combines both culture and CS together with 
partnering schools. Her background includes teaching 
elementary school students and has worked at public schools as 
well as a Tribal school before coming aboard to AISES. She holds 
a Masters Degree in Education in Curriculum & Instruction and 
an Elementary Teaching Credential.
