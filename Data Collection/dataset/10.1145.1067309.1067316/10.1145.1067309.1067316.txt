With thegrowinginterest incryptograph y|fromstuden tsandresearc hersaswellasfromthe
general public |there hasbeenacorresp onding increase inthenumberofcryptograph ytextbooks
available. Manyofthese, however,remain somewhat mired inthepast,andpresen tcryptograph y
fromapre-1980s pointofview. Indeed, there areveryfewpublished bookswhichevenmake
anattempt (letalone asuccessful one)atcoveringmoderncryptograph y.Thisunfortunate state
ofa®airs results inaserious lackofbooksdescribing thefundamen taladvances inthe¯eldthat
havetakenplace sincethemid-1980's; thisisespecially trueattheundergraduate andbeginning
graduate levels,where there isasevereneedforsuitable textsinthisarea.
Thecentralcontributions ofmodern(i.e.,post-1980) cryptograph yinclude anemphasis onpre-
cisede¯nitions, formalizations ofcryptographic goals, andprovably-se cureconstructions ofhigher-
leveltasks (e.g., signatures) fromlower-levelprimitiv es(e.g., one-w ayfunctions). Without precise
de¯nitions andrigorous proofsofsecurit y,cryptograph yisreduced toa\game" inwhichthegoal
ismerely todesign ascheme thatone's friend orcolleague cannot \break". Anyexposition of
cryptograph yfailing torecognize andemphasize thedi®erence betweentheformer andthelatter
approac hesmisses asubstan tialfraction ofwhat curren tcryptographic researc hisabout,andisa
disservice tothe¯eld. Sadly,however,almost allcryptograph ytextbooksofwhichIamawarefall
intothiscategory .
Aclassic example oftheproblems withan\ad-ho c"approac htocryptograph yisthefollowing

ACM SIGACT News 14 June 2005 Vol. 36, No. 2Some mightargue thatthere isnoplace forrigorous de¯nitions andproofsinabookdirected

1\Cryptograph y:AnIntroduction," byYaschenko
Crypto graphy...passes the\signature" testdescrib edabovewith°ying colors: inaddition to
giving aformal de¯nition ofsecurit yforsignature schemes, thebookalsodescrib es|andsketches
aproofof|theLamp ortone-time signature scheme. Evenmoresurprisingly ,itdescrib esinsome
detail (andcorrectly!) theNaor-Y ungextension oftheLamp ortscheme, whichresults inafull-
°edged signature scheme based onquite weakassumptions. Thebookalsogivesaccurate, formal
de¯nitions ofmanyother cryptographic primitiv es.
Infact,oneofthedrawbacksofthisbookisthatitcoverstoomuchmaterial inadisjoin ted
andseemingly disorganized fashion. Chapter 1,forexample, givesaveryinformal (andinformally
written) overview ofcryptograph y,running through (over?)substitution ciphers, theone-time pad,
andDi±e-Hellman keyexchange. ThisisfollowedbyChapter 2which|in11pages! |givesa
relativ elyformal introduction toone-w ayfunctions, pseudorandom generators, andzero-kno wledge
proofs.Although Iappreciated thelevelofformalit yhere(itwasheartening toseethatthedetails
weremostly correct), Idoubt thatsomeone newtothe¯eldwouldbeabletolearn muchfrom
suchatersedescription ofthese topics. Inaddition, theEnglish andwriting stylethroughout are
quite poor(itappearsthebookhasbeentranslated fromRussian), making thebookthatmuch
lessaccessible.
Thechoice oftopics intheremainder ofthebookisequally ba²ing. Chapter 3,titled \Cryp-
tographic Protocols", doesareasonable jobcoveringdigital signatures andalsodiscusses electronic
cash, coin°ipping, andsecret sharing (among others). There wasnotmuchrationale giventothe
choice oftopics, norwastheirrelation toeachother made clear. Chapter 4coverssome ofthe
number-theoretic problems underlying cryptograph y,suchasgenerating primes andtesting primal-
ity.Chapter 5discusses secret sharing schemes forarbitrary access structures |anadvanced topic

than1/3ofitspages tosimple cryptanalysis problems. Inanelemen tarybook,Iwouldexpect

Inall,theintended audience forthisbookissimply unclear tome.Studen tsapproac hingthis

2\Cryptanalysis ofNumberTheoretic Ciphers," byWagsta®
Thepreface ofCryptanalysis. ..states thatthebookarose fromanundergraduate cryptograph y
course taughtbytheauthor. Asanintroduction tocryptograph y,however,thebookfarespoorly.
Ontheother hand, forthemostpartthebookdoescontainwell-written explanations ofvarious
aspectsofnumbertheory related tocryptograph y.Thebookwouldbemuchimpro vedhadit
concen trated on,andexpanded upon,thenumber-theoretic aspectsalone instead ofcramming in
manyspurious andunrelated (nottomentioninaccurate andconfusing) chapters onsecurit yand
cryptograph y.
Iwillstartwiththepositivefeatures ofthebook.Section Igivesadecent(though attimes fast-
paced) overview ofsome ofthebasic mathematics necessary tounderstand cryptograph y.Chap-
ters1{9introduceprobabilit y,e±cien tcomputation withlargeintegers, prime numbersandtheir
distribution, modular arithmetic, Euler's theorem, Legendre/Jacobi symbols,information theory ,
andbasic group/¯eld theory .Chapters 10{15 ofSection Itreat more advanced topics including
sub-exp onentialfactoring algorithms, primalit ytesting, andalgorithms forcomputing discrete log-
arithms. Achapter onelliptic curvesandtheirapplication tofactoring andprimalit ytesting isalso
included. Overall,thechapters inthissection arequite good:the¯rst9chapters arewell-written,
andshould proveuseful toundergraduates approac hingnumbertheory forthe¯rsttime. The
latter chapters werequite thorough intheircoverage ofadvanced topics; these could servewellas
areference forresearc herswhoarealready somewhat familiar withthese topics.
Onthenegativ eside,Ifound some ofthecoverage oftheadvanced topics tobealittleterse
anddi±cult toread(although onawhole thecoverage ofthese topics was¯ne). Forexample,
Chapter 12introduces elliptic curvesaswellaselliptic-curv ealgorithms forfactoring andprimalit y
testing inatotalof12pages! Anundergraduate using thistextwouldclearly bene¯t fromaslower
presen tation ofthistopic. Also, theauthor getshimself intotrouble ashemovesfromnumber
theory tocryptograph y:Anexample isChapter 15titled \Random NumberGeneration", where
theauthor merges discussions oflinear feedbac kshiftregisters (which,tobefair,arenoted by
theauthor tobeinsecure) andtheBlum-Blum-Sh ubprovably-secure random numbergenerator,
andthenthrowsinasection onhashfunctions without carefully describing theirrelation tothe
subjectmatter ofthechapter. Inall,Ithink thebookwouldbebetterhadtheauthor cutmost
ofChapter 15andSection II(whichbothdealwithcryptograph yandsecurit y)andfocused all
hise®ort onthenumber-theoretic underpinnings ofcryptograph ywhichformthesubjectmatter
ofSection I.
Section IIincludes chapters onRijndael (i.e.,AES), public-k eyencryption schemes (confusingly
called \ciphers"), signature schemes, key-exc hange protocols,advanced cryptographic protocols
suchasoblivious transfer, zero-kno wledge proofs,andelectronic cash(among others), andthe
securit yprotocolsKerberosandPGP.Noformal de¯nitions orproofsofsecurit yaregiven,and
ACM SIGACT News 16 June 2005 Vol. 36, No. 2somefundamen talconcepts (suchaspseudorandom functions) arenotevenmentioned. Inaddition
tothefactthatthestyleandchoice oftopics are(inmyview) notthemost desirable foran
introductory course onmoderncryptograph y,Ialsofound Section IItobedisorganized andpoorly
written, withlittlemotivation orconnection betweentopics inwhat iscurren tlya\grocerylist"
of(seemingly-arbitrary) crypto protocols.Although there areoccasional nuggets ofinformation to
begleaned fromthetext,forthemostpartIfound thepresen tation disjoin tedandconfusing.
There arealsoanumberoferrors/inaccuracies inSection II:forexample, Pohlig-Hellman is
mentioned asaplausible candidate forprivate-keyencryption (inpractice, itistooine±cien ttoever
beusedassuch);\textb ook"RSAencryption isdescrib edassecure (asnoted earlier inthisreview,
itisnot);andnomentionismade ofRSAsignatures alone (instead, thebookonlydiscusses themin
thecontextofsigncryption, anoddchoice). Furthermore, thede¯nition givenfora\blockcipher"
iswrong; thebookconfuses secrecy withintegrityinthecontextofsymmetric-k eyencryption (a
common mistak e,butaninexcusable one); thetextcontainsaninaccurate de¯nition ofaone-w ay
function; andthediscussion ofPGPisconfusing andseemingly wrong. Evenifoneaccepts thatthis
isnotabookonmoderncryptograph y,thebooktriestocovertoomuchtooquickly,andwithlittle
sense ofperspective:hopping fromRijndael toX.509 certi¯cates, orfromoblivious transfer and
zero-kno wledge protocolstoadiscussion ofPGP (where mosttopics areonlytouchedonbrie°y)
doesnothelptomakethislatter section accessible.
Insummary ,Section Iofthisbookmayservewellasacompanion piece foranundergraduate
course innumbertheory withapplications; itmayalsobeuseful forstuden tsofcryptograph y
tosupplemen ttheirknowledge ofalgebraic cryptanalysis (andespecially algorithms forprimalit y
testing, factoring, andcomputing discrete logarithms). Thebookwouldalsoserveasagood
reference textonalgebraic cryptanalysis forresearc hersalready familiar withthearea. Thebookis
simply unsuitable asanintroduction tomoderncryptograph y,however,andIwouldnotrecommend
itasatextbookforsuchacourse.
3\RSA andPublic-Key Cryptograph y,"byMollin
Although thisbookdoesnotclaim toserveasatextforanintroductory course incryptograph y,I
haveincluded areview hereduetoitssimilarities withtheprevious book.Infact,there isquite a
signi¯can toverlap interms oftopics covered: the¯rst¯vechapters ofRSAandPublic-Key Cryp-
tographyalsocoverthediscrete logarithm problem andDi±e-Hellman keyexchange, theRSAand
ElGamal cryptosystems, primalit ytesting, andsub-exp onentialfactoring algorithms. Chapter 6
discusses some attacksonRSA, including timing/p owerattacks(which,more properly,should be
saidtoattackimplementations ofRSA) andlow-exp onentattacks.Identi¯cation andsignature
schemes arepresen tedinChapter 7,aswellasascheme fordigital cash. \Key managemen t"
issues (including secret sharing, keypre-distribution schemes, andPKI) arecoveredinChapter 8.
Chapter 9discusses some securit yprotocolsinverygeneral terms.
Asinthecaseoftheprevious book,thestrongest portions ofthisbookarethose thatdealwith
numbertheory; thesections dealing withcryptograph yandsecurit ywerepresen tedrather poorly
onthewhole, andwithseemingly little connection betweentopics. Examples ofthe\ad-ho c"
approac htocryptograph ytakenbythisbookabound: onesuchexample thatcaugh tmyeyewas
inthecontextofdiscussing theSchnorr identi¯cation protocol.Theauthor claims that\nobody
haseverprovedthattheprotocolissecure." Ofcourse, itisimpossible toevaluate thisstatemen t
because ade¯nition ofasecure identi¯cation protocol(evenaninformal one)isnevergivenby
theauthor. Furthermore, thisstatemen tissomewhat misleading: theSchnorr protocolhasbeen
provensecure, butonlyagainst passive attacks.Presumably ,theauthor wasreferring tosecurit y
ACM SIGACT News 17 June 2005 Vol. 36, No. 2against active attacksbutthisdoesnotcome across clearly fromthetext.
Thedescription ofRSAencryption |incontrasttowhatonemightexpectfromthebook'stitle
|issimilarly lacking. Totheauthor's credit, hedoesmentionthat\textb ook"RSAencryption is
insecure. Buthisdiscussion ofpadding techniques needed toensure securit yis,atbest,confusing:
anexponential-time attackwhichrecoversthemessage ispresen tedasmore problematic thanthe
simple factthat\textb ook"RSA encryption isdeterministic andtherefore inheren tlyinsecure.
Furthermore, theauthor mixes discussions ofseman ticsecurit yandchosen-ciphertext securit y
(without de¯ning either, ofcourse); areader whoisnotalready awareoftherelevantcryptographic
literature wouldcome awayfromthisbookwithout anyideaastohowsecure encryption canbe
based ontheRSAproblem (nor, forthatmatter, wouldtheycome awaywithanyideaofwhat
secure encryption means).
Comparing thepresen tbookandtheprevious bookontheirstrengths |namely ,theirtreatmen t
ofnumbertheory whichisrelevanttocryptograph y|Imuchpreferred Wagsta® 'sbook.Ifound
thewriting styleaswellastheorganization inWagsta® 'sbooktobemore conduciv etoagood

actually takeawayspace thatmightotherwise havebeenusedforadditional exposition), andcovers
lessmaterial thanWagsta® 'sbook.Mollin, forwhatev erreason, putsmore emphasis onRSAat
theexpenseofother cryptosystems andthissomewhat limits hiscoverage.

Inviewoftheforegoing, ...itisouropinion thatthedesign ofcryptographic systems

Thepresen tbookdoesindeed succeed atitsstated goalofpresen ting¯rmfoundations forcryp-
tograph y.Throughout, de¯nitions arecomplete anddetailed; proofsarerigorous andgiveninfull.
Chapter 1containsasurveyofthetopics coveredinthebook,andthenjumps intoa(brief)review
ofprobabilit ytheory andcomputational complexit y(including P,NP,andNP-completeness).
Thechapter concludes withsomemotivation fortherigorous treatmen tofcryptograph yadvocated
bythisbook,along thelinesofthetextquoted above.InChapter 2theauthor motivatesand
presen tsde¯nitions foroneofthecentralprimitiv esofcryptograph y:one-w ayfunctions. Avari-

Chapter 3introduces pseudorandom generators (PRGs)andpseudorandom functions (PRFs)
insome detail. Thechapter begins withadiscussion ofcomputational indistinguishabilit y(which
pervadesmuchofmoderncryptograph yevenbeyondtheapplications inthischapter) andthen
presen tsvarious de¯nitions andimplications ofPRGs.Thecoreofthechapter isaproofthat
PRGscanbeconstructed fromone-w aypermutations. Infact,animportantresult ofHastºad,
Impagliazzo, Levin, andLubyisthatone-w ayfunctions su±ce, andsome weakerversions ofthis
result (i.e.,constructing PRGsusing one-w ayfunctions withsome structure) aredescrib edhere.
Thechapter endswithaproofthatPRGscanbeusedtoconstruct PRFs, followedbyasection on
pseudorandom permutations.
Thelastchapter isdevotedentirely tozero-kno wledge (ZK) proofsystems. Thischapter is
without adoubt thebestreference forthismaterial, especially ifoneisinterested inunderstanding
thesubtleties ofthede¯nitions andconstructions. Atremendous amoun tofmaterial iscovered:
followingabriefbackground oninteractiv eproofsystems generally (andapresen tation ofaproof
system forgraph non-isomorphism), thechapter describ esaZKproofsystem forgraph isomorphism
aswellasaZKproofsystem forallofNP.Inasequence ofmore advanced sections, other topics
arediscussed: these include (among others) thenotion ofwitness-indistinguishable proofsystems,
non-in teractiv eproofsystems, aswellasproofsofknowledge.
Eachchapter endswithhistorical notes, suggestions forfurther reading (thebibliograph yis
extensiv eandquitegood,andeasily leadsthereader totherelevantresults intheliterature), anda
brieflistofopenquestions. Anappendix providesabriefreview ofsomematerial oncomputational
numbertheory whichisonlyusedatafewpointsinthebook.
Itiscertainly surprising to¯ndabookoncryptograph ythatdoesnotcoverencryption, au-
thentication, ordigital signatures! These topics areallcoveredinasecond volume bythesame
author published in2004...whichbrings metothedrawbacksofthisvolume. Clearly ,thisvolume
alone cannot beusedforanintroductory course oncryptograph y.Theauthor admits asmuchin
thePreface, butsuggests thatvolumes 1and2together could beusedforsuchacourse. Itseems
tomethatthisisabitoptimistic. Thematerial ispresen tedatanextremely highlevelwhich
makesthisbookanexcellen tresource forthose readers seeing thematerial asecond (oreventhird)

oretical computer scientist|mightnotbelostinaseaofnotations and(seemingly unimp ortant
tothenovice)subtleties. Similarly ,although Iunderstand themotivation oftheauthor topresen t

With thatinmind, thebookremains a\must-read" forallgraduate studen tsandresearc hers
