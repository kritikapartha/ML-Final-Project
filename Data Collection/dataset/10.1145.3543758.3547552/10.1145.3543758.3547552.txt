ABSTRACT
Although zoomorphic robots are already popular as companions in
some parts of the world, like Japan, they are still a niche product
in Germany and are primarily present in academia. In this study,
we analyse the effects of the new version of the zoomorphic robot
AIBO on people with disabilities living in residential care homes.
We observed the interaction for four weeks, giving the care workers
and residents complete control of the robot. We specifically looked
at factors like well-being and interaction strategies. Our findings
show mixed results. Whereas AIBO seems to have positive effects
on some residents, e.g. reducing loneliness and enhancing personal
well-being, others relate less positively to its limited functions
and language restrictions. This study indicates that AIBO has the
potential to be used meaningfully in real-world care contexts in
Germany but needs improvement to have a fully positive impact.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3543758.3547552assistance and surveillance robots usually have a human or techni-
cal appearance, companion robots mainly take an animal as their
visual model. The primary goal of these companion robots is to
interact with humans and focus on social aspects [ 5]. However,
there are also a few assistance robots with animal-like appearances
[48].
Not only does our health have an impact on our well-being, but
well-being conversely, also has a significant impact on our health.
People with poor health often struggle with depression and reduced
well-being, while people with high well-being seem to live longer
regardless of demographic factors [ 45]. Researchers refer to well-
being as the outcome of successful satisfaction of psychological
needs, such as relatedness and autonomy [ 37]. The satisfaction of
these needs through practices leads to positive experiences that
consequently increase subjective well-being [ 6,39]. However, peo-
ple cannot always adequately fulfil these needs because of physical
and psychological limitations.
Routines or social practices constitute the main manipulable fac-
tor influencing well-being [ 6]. Therefore, it makes sense to support
the needs of the constrained society by positive practices. So-called
companion robots, which are responsive to social and emotional
needs, can offer support for these positive practices [ 14,18,47]. One
such companion robot is the zoomorphic robot AIBO ERS-1000 from
the Japanese company Sony [ 40]. Despite the new AIBO’s supposed
potential and possibilities to increase well-being, this topic has not
yet been explored in German-speaking countries.
The combination of the concept of well-being and social robots
is popular, as seen, for instance, in Bradwell et al. or Campbell et al.
[8,10]. In this context, researchers mainly examine social robots
in care settings for the elderly and children with autism [ 7,11–
13,32]. They agree that social robots have the potential to increase
the well-being of children and the elderly [ 21,23,31]. Still, some
note that it is beneficial if robots include many different functions
that address well-being on multiple levels [ 22,23]. Concerning
zoomorphic robots in connection with well-being, what seems to
matter most are the expectations that the animal-like appearance
unconsciously raises in users.
The target group of zoomorphic robots consists mainly of vul-
nerable population groups: Fields of application are in the care of
the elderly, the treatment and care of dementia patients and people
with schizophrenic disorder, or the work with (autistic) children
[1,3,31,49]. Some zoomorphic robots, such as AIBO or PARO [ 33],
belong to the category of caretaker robots , which can help people
431MuC ’22, September 4–7, 2022, Darmstadt, Germany Helm et al.
learn social behaviours by caring for the robots [ 5]. In general,
studies have already shown that zoomorphic robots can be an alter-
native to conventional therapy dogs in animal-assisted therapy and
that these robots can achieve similarly positive results [ 2,3]. Nurs-
ing homes commonly use stuffed animals or zoomorphic robots
to positively influence loneliness, engagement, and agitation in
dementia patients who, for various reasons, cannot gain access to
real animals [ 1,2,31]. For example, in a recent study, researchers
observed that dementia patients showed less anxiety and seniors
in nursing homes were less lonely due to the use of zoomorphic
robots [ 31]. Researchers often express ethical concerns about the
use of robots in healthcare, especially because the main target group
consists of particularly vulnerable and sensitive members of the
population. Becker et al. argue that it could seem as if the users are
"guinea pigs" and that these communication-enabled robots with
emotions could exploit human emotions [ 5]. In general, however,
social zoomorphic robots are considered harmless if they conform
to the caretaker paradigm and do not claim to replace real animals
[5].
Figure 1: AIBO ERS-1000 [42]There are many
studies on AIBO
so far (e.g. [ 2,3,
28,29,44]). How-
ever, most of them
were conducted with
the old model. The
previous model, AIBO
ERS-7, was launched
15 years before
the current model
[41]. Since tech-
nological progress
evolves exponen-
tially, besides AIBO’s
appearance, you
can hardly com-
pare its technical
performance to that
of the predecessor model [ 36]. We see a need for an update on re-
search with the new AIBO, as it has improved drastically with its AI
capabilities, comparability to the old model therefore seems limited.
Apart from this, research related to AIBO’s impact on independent
living people at home or people with disabilities has been conducted
less frequently. Yet researchers such as Lohse et al. [ 25] recommend
precisely this context of use for AIBO. Furthermore, there are few
long-term studies on the use of AIBO, although it would be reason-
able to find out whether AIBO can also arouse interest and achieve
positive effects in the long term. However, long-term studies with
other zoomorphic robots suggest that their positive effect does not
disappear over a prolonged period [8].
The purpose of this exploratory field study is to analyze the
potential and limitations of using AIBO ERS-1000 to enhance the
well-being of people with disabilities in a residential setting. The
following research question emerges: What are the potentials and
limitations of using AIBO to support the enhancement of well-
being? It derives the hypothesis: When participants use AIBO, their
overall well-being increases.2 METHODS
AIBO was given to a residential home for mentally and multiply
disabled people for four weeks in a praxlab approach [ 30]. The
house is situated in a small village within a residential area and
used to be a private home before it was restructured to give a home
to 10 permanent residents. In advance, AIBO was demonstrated and
explained to staff and residents, and initial discussions were held
to make a first impression as part of the appropriation [ 26,46]. It
was stated that it could only communicate in English and Japanese.
Additional to the robot, the facility was handed over a diary, a
four-sided manual in accessible language and AIBO’s accessories
on the first day. During the study, no technician or similar was on
site, as the operation was to be made possible by the care workers
themselves.

The study contains of four different data types: (1) Interviews;
(2) Observations and (3) Diaries.
(1) Semi-structured guided interviews were used because they
generate similar topics, but leave room for in-depth questions [ 9,
20]. Two different guides were developed, containing themes and
questions in an unordered sequence. Interviews were conducted
with a care worker and two residents to get their assessment of
AIBO and the time with it.
(2) In this study, participant observation describes a short ob-
servation on site, in which the observer takes part in the activities
and conversations. This qualitative method was used because it can
capture real-life behaviour and generate implicit knowledge that
cannot be articulated [15, 34, 43].
(3) To unobtrusively record timely subjective impressions of staff,
the diary method was used [ 4]. The diary generated semi-structured
data as it provided questions but also allowed free entries [ 4]. In
addition, a care worker kept notes on her initiative, which she
handed over for evaluation.
The observation protocols and diary entries were digitised and
imported into MaxQDA together with the digital interview tran-
scripts. Following this, a reflexive thematic analysis according to
Clarke and Braun was carried out, in which the data were coded
inductively and later divided into meaningful themes [ 16]. Themes
that emerged included "self-efficacy", "loneliness", "work process",
432Zoomorphic Robots and People with Disabilities MuC ’22, September 4–7, 2022, Darmstadt, Germany
"language barrier", "appearance", and "comparison with real dog"
among others.
2.1 Data Privacy and Ethics
We distributed participant documents to inform all participants
of the procedures and obtain their consent. They were signed in
advance by the participants or by a legal representative. An ethical
application has been approved by the ethical board of the University
of Siegen with the ethical application number ER_31/2021. Addi-
tionally, possible ethical problems and AIBO’s use were discussed
with the care workers in advance. A perpetual help were the care
workers and the therapy dog, who the residents could rely on. The
duration of the study and by it the stay of AIBO were made trans-
parent several times throughout the study. Addressing data privacy,
we filled in a record of processing activities prior to the study and
pseudonymised all personal data. AIBO did not collect any data, as
it was not connected to the internet.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Integration Strategy
In the residential home, the integration strategy consisted of us-
ing AIBO as a companion to everyday activities and occasionally
as a tool for individual activation. The staff read the manual and
obtained information from the internet to inform themselves about
AIBO. The use of the residents was characterised by free or guided
interaction. Either the residents approached AIBO on their own,
or the care workers carried out commands with them and gave
them AIBO to stroke. However, care workers were exclusively re-
sponsible for turning AIBO on and off, and it often ran until the
battery was empty. Even when the interest dropped shortly, the
care workers could still use AIBO in a targeted way. AIBO did not
change the basic daily structure of the residents. The staff used
AIBO as another tool for occupation and therapy. There was no
fixed time for AIBO’s deployment, and the duration varied between
20 minutes and two hours. Often AIBO ran around freely in the
communal room and interacted with the residents by offering tricks
or barking. The residents watched it, talked to it or petted it. In
addition to this free interaction, the staff also used it for targeted
interaction in the group. During this, they placed AIBO in between
the residents on the ground, table or sofa. The residents observed
AIBO and were supported by the care workers during the interac-
tion, where they spoke to or stroked it. Occasionally AIBO was also
used with individual residents alone. For example, it accompanied
one to physiotherapy or laid next to another in her bed. These
residents were then asked to watch or stroke it. However, AIBO
was mainly used in the communal room or garden.
3.2 Impact on Loneliness
We noticed that many residents talked directly to AIBO or others
about it. Apart from the commands, they addressed it mainly in
German. They would often talk to other residents or the staff about
their experiences with the robot. They talked about where it be-
longed, speculating that it would not be allowed at the workplace
since it was a type of dog. Especially AIBO’s songs stimulated con-
versations, too. In addition, it was also common for participants
to observe AIBO and comment on its behaviour. For example, onecommented that AIBO had an easy-going nature, was well-behaved
and good at performing tricks. There was evidence that AIBO can
also strengthen group cohesion. AIBO brought fun, helped to in-
clude reticent people in the group, and created a common theme.
Residents who mainly stuck to themselves joined others to interact
with AIBO. For some participants, AIBO triggered their protective
instinct. They protected it from other participants and made sure
it did not fall off the table. Especially two residents struggled with
farewell pain and missing AIBO. During the farewell, AIBO was
once again petted, hugged or given a paw by each resident. One
resident often repeated, that he wanted it to stay and was sad to
see it go. While he kept asking when it was coming back, others
did not care that the time was over. Another resident had a picture
taken with AIBO and burst into tears when it was wrapped up. The
staff had to comfort and reassure her together with the therapy
dog. During the study, it was noticeable that the participants often
expressed affection towards AIBO by petting, cuddling, kissing it or
similar. Thus, one of the most frequent interactions with AIBO was
petting. For example, one resident greeted AIBO by stroking it and
giving it air kisses when she came home from work. Another ex-
pression of affection was shown in the language used by a resident,
who called AIBO "Ada Prankster" or "Ada Waggle Dog", among
other things, and used positive adjectives to describe it. According
to the staff, this is how he expresses his affection. This resident also
stroked AIBO, although he never stroked the therapy dog. He did
not like fur but liked dogs - AIBO gave him an alternative. Still, a
care worker complained about the cold surface.
3.3 Impact on Self-efficacy and Mental and
Physical Activation
A major problem concerning the interaction with AIBO was the
English-only language control (it reacts to commands like ’sit’,
’shake’, or ’lay down’). The majority of the residents did not know
English and had to rely on the help of their supervisors. In addition,
it took AIBO a long time to execute a command. If AIBO did not
execute an order at all, users could not determine with certainty
whether it deliberately refused or did not understand it. While
successful interaction with AIBO often led to a feeling of joy, frus-
tration quickly set in when it failed. If a command was successful,
the participants were visibly proud of themselves, but if AIBO did
not respond to them, they lost interest.
It was noticeable that AIBO attracted attention and was able
to provide a positive distraction from the resident’s reality. The
residents observed AIBO, commented on its behaviour and more
or less focused their attention on it. It turned out that AIBO could
awaken memories - especially of former pets. In addition, some
found that they liked to record their time with AIBO and thus
create mementoes, such as printed pictures and videos with it.
Residents who usually moved less had an incentive to mobilise
their physical resources. AIBO motivated to train the residents’ fine
motor skills and coordination. For example, a resident with physical
limitations stroked AIBO and threw it the ball. Many often bent
down to AIBO or protected it with their arms. There were residents
with spasticity or hemiplegia. Through AIBO, these residents could
be motivated, for example, to use the affected arm for stroking.
This way, the residents had an incentive to exercise their mobility.

However, motivation was not long-lasting due to AIBO’s limited
functions.
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Our hypothesis that zoomorphic robots like AIBO affect the well-
being of residents of a group home for people with mental and
multiple disabilities can be confirmed, but only to some degree. We
saw that it can satisfy several needs, such as relatedness, and has a
positive influence on physical and mental activation as well as lone-
liness. AIBO could also offer the potential to benefit self-efficacy
as seen in the feeling of joy triggered by a sense of achievement,
although the language barrier and laggard response time disadvan-
tage this effect.
Even if the specialized setting is under critique for lack of in-
clusion of its residents [ 38], the residential home for people with
disabilities seems well suited for AIBO’s use. In our study, the
robot was integrated into everyday life and used for guided and
unguided group and individual interaction. Various requirements
of the residents, such as coordination or attention training could
be fulfilled by it and it had a positive influence on the well-being,
the physical and mental activation and the perceived loneliness
of several residents. In addition, it sustained interest, and some
residents build an emotional connection with the robot throughout
our study, which, according to Kertész and Turunen, is necessary
for successful prolonged use [ 24]. Therefore, we could also observe
the positive influence that is described in previous research in some
residents with mental or multiple disabilities [ 2,28,29,44]. In our
study, AIBO was useful in the interaction with adults - and not only
children - with autism, as has already been increasingly studied
with AIBO and other social robots [ 44,49]. The fact that AIBO was
able to fit well into the residential home for people with disabili-
ties is further in line with a study stating that AIBO is particularly
suitable for domestic settings [25].
On the topic of loneliness we could observe that AIBO does
have an impact on the participants. It strengthened group cohesion,
stimulated communication and served as a conversation opener.
These results reinforce previous findings that technology and social
robots can stimulate social interactions and support interpersonal
communication [ 12,13,27,28]. The increased expression of affec-
tion towards AIBO and the parting pain suggest that some residents
had perceived AIBO as a social interaction partner over the course
of our study and were emotionally attached to it. Through AIBO,
residents were additionally able to act out their protective instinct
and their need to care for someone or something without having to
carry the responsibility for a real animal. This finding reinforces the
classification of AIBO in the caretaker paradigm [5]. The well-being
of people who cannot work with real animals or specifically benefit
from AIBO’s distinct capabilities can improve from AIBO’s suit-
ability as an alternative therapy tool in animal- or robot-assisted
therapy, as these results and previous research suggest [2, 3, 17].
The influence of AIBO on physical and mental activation is
another aspect that we could observe. AIBO could activate the
mind, trigger emotions and draw attention to itself and thus create
a connection to reality. In addition, it awakened memories of, for
example, one’s pets and evoked the desire to build memories during
our study. Our finding that AIBO can trigger emotions is in line withprevious research that attributes social robots to support pleasure,
elicit fun and joy and create emotional attachment [ 19][31][24].
Additionally, our results are consistent with research that attributes
zoomorphic robots to be cognitively stimulating [ 5]. In terms of
physical activation, the results of our study show that AIBO prompts
participants to mobilise their resources, motivates them and helps
to strengthen their fine motor and coordination skills. Overall, the
results of this study show positive impacts on activation, although
restricted by its functional limits.
Our findings regarding AIBO’s influence on loneliness, self-
efficacy and activation already show that the robot can rather satisfy
the needs for relatedness, autonomy, competence, and physicality.
This, in turn, should result in increased well-being according to
Deci and Ryan [ 37]. Many of our participants expressed themselves
very positively about AIBO and their time with it.
However, the language barrier is a disadvantage. The users could
hardly give commands without the help of the staff and were some-
times poorly understood by AIBO due to incorrect pronunciation.
The laggard reaction time also harms self-efficacy since a causality
between command and reaction is not always clearly recognisable.
Both favour unclear or wrong feedback and lead to frustration and
declining interest on the part of the users. Because of the robot’s
potential to trigger joy as a result of successful interaction, it could
nevertheless offer the potential to benefit self-efficacy.
Overall, we believe that AIBO’s potential to benefit well-being
lies primarily in its impact on users’ perceived loneliness which
some see as an outcome of the socially segregating setting of the
residential home. While AIBO can stimulate interpersonal commu-
nication by acting as a conversation opener, creating a common
theme, acting as a social partner, and providing people with a posi-
tive distraction and an opportunity to talk, it can not replace real
personal interaction with others outside the home. The affection
shown to AIBO and pet-like interaction show that users can emo-
tionally connect with it, and it can trigger positive emotions and joy
in them. Both, in groups and individually, users can be motivated
by it and activated and encouraged both mentally and physically.
Through its proactive behaviour, it integrates even reticent people
into interactions and draws their attention to reality. These results
are in line with other studies that attribute to social robots the
potential to increase well-being in older people and people with
dementia and autism [8, 21, 23, 31].
Future research should investigate and validate these results,
as this is only an exploratory field study and the duration of four
weeks is not enough to observe long-term effects. The results found
here only provide a small insight into the topic of AIBO and well-
being. In addition, its use in residential homes for disabled people
should be explored further, as AIBO’s use yielded promising results
here. The effects of AIBO on self-efficacy should be investigated
again when users speak the same language as AIBO.
