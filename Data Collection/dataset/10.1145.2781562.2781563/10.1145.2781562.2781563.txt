ABSTRACT  
Nowadays, the economic environment is competitive, various 
companies are all competing for the greatest profit; but create the 
blue ocean market is not so easy. Therefore, in foreign, many 
successful businesses focus on human, usage of incentives, empow erment, and educational training to increase the employees' 
commitment to the organization and to improve efficiency. 
Enterprise is an organization of human, most of the links cannot 
be surpassed or replaced. In contrast, the salary is generally low in domestic enterprises. The phenomenon of employees are squeezed 
is not uncommon. Managers sacrifice human capital in exchange 
for a slight profit. Take the service industry for example, when 
employees are treated unfairly, how do they service and satisfy the customers? Therefore, this study takes the customer -oriented 
market for survey objection. From the perspective of employee, under the business through internal marketing and managers' 
charismatic leadership, to understand whether the employees can 
bring good effects to increase organizational commitment. At the same time, whether employees are able to provide a better service 
to customer through organizational commitment, to improve 
performance and bring the greater profits for company. This study firstly co nfirms research variables and the framework by literature 
reviews, and then uses online questionnaires to collect data. 
Finally, we use SPSS, AMOS and SEM to test the hypotheses in 
this study. Under the framework for internal marketing, the results of rese arch are as the followings:  
1. Internal marketing will positively affect the organizational commitment.  
2. Organizational commitment will positively affect performance.  
3. Charismatic leadership will enhance the effect of organizational commitment and perf ormance.  This study finds out that when the organization provides education and training, reward system and good communication channels, employees can effectively improve organizational 
commitment, dedication to the organization over the long term 
and are willing to stay; further increase their skills and knowledge of company, to bring better performance. In addition, managers 
can enhance the effect of organizational commitment to 
performance. In other words, charismatic leader can lead and influence employ ees, is the cornerstone of a successful business. 
Finally, the expected results of this study can provide a reference of charismatic leadership to academic, and also help companies improve their performance and to maintain the competitive 
advantage with th e right thinking.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Research Background and Motivation  
An increasingly competitive economic environm ent, service 
industries have developed numbers of strategies to gain competitive advantage. The product sales are related with many 
reasons and also related with sales people. They are the first line 
personnel and contact with customers directly. Businesse s need to 
build relationships with customers, and the first line staffs meet their needs. The customers will refer others to the business and its products and services and would like to keep coming back. 
Therefore, the high level of organizational commitment make 
employees have a stronger sense of belonging, are willing to share knowledge and experience, learn new skills, provide suggestions 
and comments, and pay more attention to improve quality and 
productively (Osterman, 2006). The staff with high commit ment 
give customers the greater satisfaction and return performance to 
company.  
And from the other perspective, the leadership style of 
management deeply affects the employees’ performance. Charismatic leadership, defined as a person’s ability to influenc e 
others based on a supernatural gift and attractive powers (Bertocci, 2009), could be effective, because one of the most important effects of charismatic leadership is that the charismatic 
leader is deemed as an object of identification and try to emulate 
his or her behavior and the employees accept the higher goals or 
have more confidence in their ability to contribute to the 
realization of the company’s target (Lussier and Achua 2010).

In discussing these areas of charismatic leaders hip, internal 
marketing orientation, employees’ organizational commitment and 
performance; we try to identify knowledge gaps and suggest 
research questions relevant to these gaps that warrant attention. The questions of this study are following:  
I. Most st udies explore the relationship of internal marketing 
orientation, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. Meager empirical research on internal marketing orientation has focused on outcomes at the employee level. Internal marketing 
orientation imp roves organizational commitment and job 
satisfaction, and does have a significant influence. However, 
previous researches lack of the research to performance.  
II. Furthermore, managers’ leadership style will affect the 
subordinates even the development of company. The previous 
researchers explore leadership widely; they are shown leadership 
will affect employees’ organizational commitment and job 
satisfaction. Therefore, this article is focusing on “Charismatic 
Leadership”, and explores the charismatic lead ership of managers 
and frontline employees. According to the questions of this study, 
we hope to reach the following research purposes:  
I. To explore the relationship between internal marketing 
orientation, employee commitment and performance.  
II. To expl ore the relationship between charismatic leadership, 
employee commitment and performance.  
2. Literature Review and Hypothesis  
2.1 Internal Marketing  Orientation and 
Employee Commitment  
Kyriazopoulos et al. (2007) examined the internal marketing 
concept from the branches of Bank, and they found that internal 
marketing has a positive effect on organizational commitment. Moreover, Farzad et al. (2008) in their research on employees among Iranian financial service arena found that internal 
marketing has a positiv e effect on organizational commitment. 
Hung and Lin (2008) suggested that employees' perception in the managerial system of the internal marketing has a positive effect 
on the organizational commitment in Taiwan International Hotel Industries. Based on the se, the following hypothesis is developed:  
H1: Internal Marketing Orientation is positively related to 
Employee Commitment.  
2.2 Employee Commitment and Performance   
The relationship of organizational commitment and performance 
is stronger when performance  indicators are based on self -
reporting than when they are examined by a supervisor or by the 
indicators of objective performance (Riketta, 2002). It should be noted the relationship in terms of organizational commitment and 
performance, many studies lean on how job performance contributes to the overall performance of the company (Shaw et 
al., 2003; Tourigny, Baba, Han and Wang, 2013), and including 
the financial perspective (Dimitriades and Papalexandris, 2011), for the reason that one can make the follow ing hypothesis:  
H2: The greater the Employees’ Commitment, the greater is the Performance.  
2.3 Charismatic leadership and Employee 
Commitment   
Charismatic leadership is delineated in different ways by many 
scholars, and it is depending on the type and nat ure of their work 
(Choi, 2006). Nevertheless, the illustrative mysterious nature of charismatic leaders in literature, most of the earlier scholars 
established consensus on the fact that charismatic leadership has extraordinary influence on the subordinate s’ effort, motivation 
and performance than any other forms of leadership (Bass et al., 2003; Choi, 2006). Many studies relating charismatic leader behaviors to performance outcomes have neglected important 
moderator variables and itself as moderator (Shami r and Howell, 
1999). Sosik and Dinger (2007) thought that transformational and 
charismatic leaders with high self -monitoring ability might be 
more likely to identify needs, values, and preferences. In addition, with respect to their own behaviors and attit udes, to better 
accommodate those values and preferences. Therefore, we 
hypothesize that by following:  
H3a: The relationship between Employee Commitment and 
Performance is positively moderated by Solicitude of Charismatic Leadership.  
H3b: The relationship between Employee Commitment and 
Performance is positively moderated by Faith and Belief of Charismatic Leadership.  
H3c: The relationship between Employee Commitment and 
Performance is positively moderated by Innovation of Charismatic 
Leadership.  
H3d: The relationship between Employee Commitment and 
Performance is positively moderated by Adventure and risk -taking 
of Charismatic Leadership.  
2.4 Conceptualizing the Model   
The benefits of charismatic leadership are not simply demonstrated to incremental eff ects but also to more dramatic 
advance in employees' performance. For this reason we look at the moderating effects of charismatic leadership. The hypothesized relationships (H1 -H3) are combined in the framework shown in 
Figure 2.1

Performance.3. Methodology and Data Analysis  
3.1 Measurement model (Validity, Reliable 
and Correlation)  
This study choose Amos to analyze confirmatory factor analysis 
(CFA) by explore each dimension of the scale. Convergent 
validity of the resulting scales comply with Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) stipulations, e.g. all indicator loadings are significant and 
exceed 0.7, and the average variance extracted (AVE) by each 
construct exceeds 0.5. Therefore, these values are expected and 
indicate this study has a greater convergent validity and 
discriminant validity. (see table  3.1.1 and table 3 .1.2).

3.3 Moderation Effect Test   
3.3.1 Multi -group Structural Equation Model  
This study uses the multi -group structural equation model to 
examine the effects of moderator variables. When testing the moderating effects, the following three steps to confirm the presence of moderating effects:  
i. Grouping the moderator variables (high group and low group).  
ii.Validating the effectiveness of grouping.  
a.Testing the capability of Discriminant function  
b. Using independent samples t -test 
iii. Multi-group structural equation m odel.  
a. The model fit test of single sample  
b. The identity test of path coefficient 
According to Joreskog and Sorbom (1996), this study uses the 
multi-group structural equation model (AMOS) to analyze 
second -order model of identical concept in both high group and 
low group, and to test whether the model presented moderator 
effect. First, constructing three structural equation models (SEM) 
include of full sample SEM, high group SEM and low group SEM to examine the model fit test of single sample.  (see tab le 3.3.1.1)

High Group AR  0.33The results of high group are all greater than the results of low 
group (see Table 3.3.1.2 ). The m oderating effects of FB, IN and 
AR are significant. Thus, based on moderating path analysis results, when in the “high degree of faith and belief”, the correlation of employees’ organizational commitment to 
performance has stronger positive effect than in the “low degree 
of faith and belief”. It can be seen the effects of “innovation” and 
“adventure and risk -taking” are same. We can get the following 
inferences:  
i. When the managers with high faith and belief, have the moderating effect on employees’ organ izational commitment to 
performance.  
ii. When the managers with high innovation, have the moderating effect on employees’ organizational commitment to performance.  
iii. When the managers with high adventure and risk -taking, have 
the moderating effect on employees’ organizational commitment to performance. The result of research hypothesis based on literature review will be described following:

4. Conclusion  
4.1 Structural Model of Charismatic 
Leadership   
The goals of thi s study try to know the traits of charismatic 
leadership such as solicitude, innovation, faith, belief, adventure 
and risk -taking how to impact on employees. While the managers 
bring those traits of charismatic leadership into management process, especiall y frontline employees who contact with 
customers directly, employees could feel the different 
management styles than before. According to the result of 
empirical study, internal marketing orientation, employees’ organizational commitment and charismatic leadership definitely 
increase the performance.  
4.2 Solicitude of Charismatic Leadership may 
not be good  
Contrary to our expectations, the solicitude of charismatic path 
was not significant. The nature of our data collection, in which the employees served, may help to explain this finding. The third largest sample of occupation is student, and the overall age range 
is young. This part of sample affected the results which are less 
significant. We may deduce the managers of part -time job are less 
solicitude or  they do not care about this aspect that how managers 
treat them.  5. Managerial Implication  
According to the empirical results of structural model, we provide recommends to enhance the faith and belief, increase the 
innovation, strengthen the spirit of adventure and risk -taking in 
order to raise the employees’ organizational commitment and 
performance. In addition, managers also could increase the 
employees’ commitment to organization and their performance 
through the good internal marketing orientation.  
5.1 Internal Marketing Orientation in 
Organization  
Based on the data collection, we find out the employees are 
almost belonged to young groups and served as business, service, and student, and also set up a filtering item. In this situation, internal marketin g orientation does have a significant impact on 
employees’ organizational commitment and performance in the customer -oriented industries.  
An enterprise’s internal marketing orientation including internal 
communication, human resource management initiative s, reward 
system, education and training make the employees more 
efficient. Enterprises offer the chances to education and training 
for employees, they can further the understanding of the 
companies’ mission, purpose and philosophy, to put efforts in the 
correct direction. Besides, there are good internal communication 
channels in organization; link with employees, management can 
be the first time to understand the needs and conditions of 
employees; so that they can focus more on their works, thus 
improving  efficiency. Moreover, good reward system is essential 
conditions as a good business. Employees can compete healthy to 
fight for their reward, which enables companies to grow further 
and improve competitiveness. Finally, combining with the human resource i nitiatives, treat the employees as the internal customer 
and meet their needs. They will be also on the minds of customer awareness, and better satisfy the customers’ needs. That is the operational boulevard of long -term and success for businesses.  
5.2 Charismatic Leadership in Organization  
According to the research findings, most of charismatic leader 
traits, except solicitude, have the significant and positive 
moderating effect on employees’ organizational commitment to performance. Earlier scholar believed charismatic leadership occurs only when the organization in crisis or in change.  
The economic environment is competitive; enterprises must 
constantly innovate to gain competitive advantage. We think that 
charismatic leadership happens anywhere when th e organizations 
are always changing. Managers, who are in charge of certain 
tasks, have to strengthen themselves and learn from the other 
good leaders to cope with changes in the organizations and better 
influence their employees.  The managers have courag e to play, confidence in the decision-
making and behavior that enable the employees recognized and trust to them. Besides, managers often are led by example, which can have a positive impact on employees and are worth learning model. Furthermore, managers should be innovative, willing to 
accept new areas of knowledge and skills, also lead and encourage 
employees to pursue new things. Last, managers have the adventurous spirit and a clear ambition, even faced with 
difficulties and in the unstable unpredictable environment, they 
often do positive thinking and able to well adapt.  
5.3 Research Limitation and Further ResearchThis study is not without its limitations, and we propose several 
points in the following:  
i. The quantitative method of scale limits a ma terial effect on the 
performance in our study. Because our study chooses the Likert scales to measure internal marketing orientation and charismatic 
leadership, each respondent has different level of cognitive so that 
cause an implausible result. Therefore, we propose that further experimental and longitudinal research would enable to investigate whether relationships are unidirectional or reciprocal 
(Schneider et al., 1998).  
ii. The target unit of analysis was only relied on whose work 
contact with custome rs directly. Even though this scope allowed 
us easily to control of inter -organizational and inter -industry 
differences, there still are limitations for our ability to apply these 
findings to other industries.  
iii. It is not objective because the extent to abs tract charismatic 
leadership and internal marketing orientation into each company might also have been limited by individual differences.  
iv. The final limitation is that there haven’t had the mature scales 
of charismatic leadership from the prior research; f urthermore, the 
structural model in our study built by ourselves might not have 
enough perceived credibility for further research.  
These limitations notwithstanding, there are important further 
research directions deriving from our research. To analyze 
specifically, we recommend further research that could divide 
from charismatic leadership in detail.  
i. One direction could be discussed from the other industry side:  
In this study, we restrict the sample that the employees contact 
with customers directly; it may represent the most respondents served as service industry. Regardless of the industry, internal 
marketing orientation and managers’ charismatic leadership both 
are important. Further research could analyze the competitive comparison of different doma ins. Understanding the research 
differences in variety of industries will make more subjective.  ii. Another direction could be from the manager side:  
As facing the macro environment changing, managers must have 
the ability to adapt to change. The future r esearch can use the 
depth interviews to access managers to understand the effect of 
internal marketing orientation and charismatic leadership in that 
company. Further research may discuss the other traits during the 
process of management, so that can sum u p charismatic leadership 
traits to successful businesses.
