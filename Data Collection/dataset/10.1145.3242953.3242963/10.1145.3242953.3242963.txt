Any computer scientist who does research in logic and veriﬁcation will sooner or
later cross their path with Presburger arithmetic. This column, authoritatively and
accessibly composed by Christoph Haase, ﬁlls the gap for a state-of-the-art introduc-
tion to the logic of Presburger arithmetic and its algorithmic properties. As well as
conveying an illuminating brief history, the article provides plenty of pointers to on-
going cutting-edge work.
