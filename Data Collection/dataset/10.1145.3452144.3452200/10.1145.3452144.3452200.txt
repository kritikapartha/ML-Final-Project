with details; the student with very high category were 1 %, 
students with high category were 10.8 %, students with a

Muhammadiyah as a social organization has a variety of 
educational models developed starting from the level of early 
childhood education up to colleges, including the boarding 
school

based education model 
 
[1

. The educational model held at 
the Mu

and mission of Islamic Boarding School Education, which is 
based on Al

Islam and Kemuhammadiyahan and is holistic, by 
equipping students with religious and gener

adolescents with high levels of spiritual well
-
being have a low 
risk of bullying 
[15]
. Spiritual well
-
being is positively corre
lated 
to positive personality 
[16
],
 
and
 
spi
ritual well
-
being has a 
significant relationship to mental health
 
[17].
 
The complexity of problems encountered by students in the 
learning process needs various psychological competencies that 
can help them to dev
elop their self
-
wellness. Concep
tually,
 
wel
lness is a part of individual development that has reciprocal 
relation with physical, cognitive, emotional, social, and spiritual 
dimensions 
[18] [19
]. 
Every wellness dimension is related and 
depends on each other
. The level of functioning and m
alfunct
ion 
of a wellness dimension influences the functioning of the other 
wellness dimensions 
[20]
.
 
Wellness is continuous and multi
-
dimensions 
[21]
. 
Every 
dimension is depended on each other and when they are integrated 
ba
lanced they will help the indivi
dual to
 
dev
elop themselves 
optimally 
[22]
. The spiritual dimension is the center of balance of 
interaction among wellness dimensions 
[23],[24]
. Spirituality is 
the aspect that adheres to every human development stage. It is 
not only a range of beliefs or t
he abil
ity 
of one's spirit but also the 
intrinsic component of human life 
[25]
.
 
The spiritual life (the contemplation of religiosity, philosophy 
view, or values of life) is the essential part and the definitive 
character of 
humans. The individual who can d
evelop 
spir
itual 
wellness is categorized as "transcendent self
-
actualize", the one 
who reaches the highest hierarchy 
[26]
.
 
The spiritual dimension is the component that relates all wellness 
dimensions and has the reciprocal 
character to the other wellness 
dimensi
ons.
 
This means every wellness dimension naturally 
includes the spiritual aspect. Finally, it can be concluded that 
every dimension is not independent, rather they are intertwined. 
The spiritual wellness becomes the a
dhesive component in the 
interac
tion of
 
all
 
wellness dimensions 
[27], [28]
, 
T
he spiritual 
wellness becomes the center of all wellness dimensions in the 
individual life
. 
 
Based on a study of research related to the positive impact of 
spiritual well
-
being on
 
adolescent development, it can 
be assu
med 
that spiritual well
-
being is an important part of students' 
development so that the mapping of the level of spiritual well
-
being among students of the Muhammadiyah Boarding School in 
Tasikmalaya needs to be done a
s a rational basis for the 
devel
opment 
of g
uidance and counseling services programs that 
can be used to help the improve of Students' spiritual well
-
being.
 
 
Developing student spiritual wellness trough counseling service 
based on two foundations, formal ju
ridical foundation and 
empirical
 
founda
tion
 
of wellness counseling in practice [
29
]. 
Formal Juridal foundation for developing spiritual wellness 
according to t
he purpose o
f
 
national education 
that state 
“education 
is helping the development of students' po
tential to be 
a faithful human b
eing to
 
God
 
Almighty, have good characters, 
healthy, knowledgeable, creative, independent, and become the 
democratic and responsible citizen 
[30]
.
 
The formal juridical basis implies the basic principle which is in 
line with 
the concept of spiritual wellnes
s. Spir
itua
l wellness is 
the equilibrium center and wellness development. The wellness 
dimension includes faith, values, and purposes of life, self
-
development skill, being able to live harmoniously
 
[31]. 
 
The formal legal b
ase of the students' spiritual w
ellness
 
dev
elopment has been fixed and steady. Along with that, the trend 
in guidance and counseling refers to optimization and 
empowering given through professional service to help 
individuals to reach mental
 
health
, well
-
b
eing, education, and the 
career 
objecti
ve 
[
32]
. 
Essentially, the basic objective of guidance 
and counseling is to help an individual to attain optimum self
-
development, while the study of wellness development is intended 
to help an individual to attain har
mony in life to elucidate every 
life ev
ents
 
positively. 
 
 
The 
specific program of spiritual wellness development 
in 
guidance and counseling of Indonesia context has no any special 
program that is empirically tested, therefore this condition shall be 
able t
o stimulate the researchers in g
uidance
 
and
 
counseling in 
schools and other sectors to construct a comprehensive service 
model in guidance and counseling to help each student to develop 
the whole self
-
potential and to attain an entire self
-
wellness
[33]

, among the indicators 
that appear are fear of disaster strikes, pray only when there is a 
need, lack of worship spirit, fear of death. The se
cond aspect of 
meaning and purpose in life shows 76
% achievement, with 
a 
prominent indicator is being able to
 
inte
rpret life positively, 
students lack clear goals in life, less able to be grateful, and less 
optimistic in living life. The third aspect of in
ternal resources has 
only reached 48%, which means 
that students have v
ery low 
confidence in themselves, very
 
low 
motivation in developing 
themselves, complaining, and do not have freedom of will. The 
fourth aspect of harmony with nature in this category o
nly reached 
47%, where students are less able to do

The profile of spiritual well

aspect shows that aspects of meaning and purpose i

aspects o
f internal resources show the lowest a
chiev
ement 
compared to the other two aspects. This condition 
correlated with 
fact that
 
adolescents in Boarding School are still looking for their 
i
dentity independently, they must submit and be boun
d by the 
existing ru
les
 
[
34
]
 
Naturally, the development of
 
spir
itual well
-
being is in line with 
the increasing interest in studying religion 
[
35
]
, 
many teenagers 
learn about religion as a source of emotion
al and intellectual 
stimulation. Adolescents accord
in
g to Fowler, Good 
& 
Willoughby [
36
]
 
are considered as a 
perio
d of 'spiritual 
awakening' which is characterized by the search for existential 
meaning, increased capacity for a spiritual experience, and th
e 
process of challenging traditional religious valu
es.
 
Referring to the
 
opinion can be understood if the achi
eveme
nt 
level of students' spiritual well
-
being still shows diversity and 
tends to be in the medium and low categories. The conditions 
must be inte
rpreted as opportunities to assist students in 
deve
loping spiritual wel
l
-
being because spiritual development 
is a 
continuous process, it means that spiritual well
-
being is not a 
matter of already having or not, but about how to improve the 
achievement of s
piritual well
-
being 
[
37
].
 
Findings that indicate a 
tendency for low lev

indic
ate a need for appropriate guidance and

W

[

.
 
The development 
of guidance and 
counseling services is
 
one 
of the efforts to encourage the 
achievement of optimal spiritual well

reased 
when gaining positive encouragement from the

. Besides, the

is i

other development dimensions, such as social dimension, 
psychosexual, and moral development. This indicates that the 
develo
