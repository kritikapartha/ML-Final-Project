ABSTRACT
It must be admitted that with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, conventional face-to-face learning has been disrupted. Luck-
ily, we have to thank to advances in science and technology, so
that the learning system does not have to stop, but can continue
even though by online learning, either through zoom meeting or
google meet or other online media. In such a context, this research
was conducted with the main objective of finding out whether
compulsory curriculum subjects, especially Pancasila Education
and Religion Education, can still have a significant influence on
character building through Value Education? Therefore, this simple
research used quantitative methods by distributing questionnaires
to 150 students as simple random sampling. From the data obtained,
it was found the result that Pancasila Education and Religion Edu-
cation still have a significant influence on Value Education which
at Bina Nusantara University the values is focused to the value
of SPIRIT (Striving for the excellent, Perseverance, Integrity, Re-
spect, Innovation, and Teamwork). So, it can be concluded that
the COVID-19 condition must not slacken the spirit to shape the
character of students through Pancasila Education and Religion
Education, so that core values of Bina Nusantara University remain
embedded in students.

1 INTRODUCTION
The history of the Indonesian nation is marked by the role of young
people. Starting from the establishment of Boedi Oetama in 1908,
Soempah Pemoeda in 1928, to the Independence of the Republic
of Indonesia, including the reform of Indonesia in 1998. Indonesia
as a developing country continues to improve not only in the field
of economy and infrastructure, but also developing in the internet
world, especially related to with information that continues to
change due to advances in science and technology that seems to be
unstoppable, thus giving birth to the flow of globalization. Along
with the current of globalization, Indonesian people, especially
young people.
On the other hand, it is undeniable that there is a phenomenon
of teenagers involved in crime. The trigger, among others, is the
ease of getting information about the hedonistic lifestyle that is
all glittery and modern. Apparently, apart from bringing positive
benefits, the development of science and technology also has a
119ICBDC 2022, May 27–29, 2022, Shenzhen, China Arcadius Benawa et al.
negative impact on society. The latest technological sophistication
has almost changed the mindset of people, starting from early
childhood, teenagers, parents. The rise of global lifestyles is the
impact of globalization that cannot be dammed anymore. That’s
the other side of the impact of technological sophistication. It is
as if various high-tech tools have become an important part of the
lives of young people in particular and society in general. It all
results in a lot of crime in society, so that the family seems to be
dysfunctional as an educational institution.
Education according to the 2003 National Education System Law
aims to build the potential of students to become human beings
who have skills, faith, and noble character (Yuliana et al., 2020).
Meanwhile education itself can be defined as providing individuals
with knowledge, attitudes, values, and behaviors that will have a
positive impact on students’ lives (Sari, 2013). Meanwhile, character
education in Indonesia according to the 2003 National Education
System Law aims to build the potential of students to become
human beings who have good skills, desires, and morals (Pahlevi,
2017).
Pancasila Education is one way to instill a moral and broad-
minded personality in the life of the nation and state (Krisnamukti
et al., 2020). Therefore, Pancasila education must be given at every
level of education, from elementary, secondary to tertiary levels.
However, it must be admitted that in recent years there has been a
decline in student interest in Pancasila education (Kristiono, 2017).
In fact, Pancasila education was held in order to raise the humanis-
tic element, namely Pancasila human (Sitorus, 2016). While other
researchers actually found that students’ attitudes did not apply
the values of Pancasila in their life. Therefore, it is necessary for
Pancasila Education to be redesigned in such a way that it is ap-
propriate to be taught at various levels of education from low to
higher level (Anggraini et al. , 2020). As for the various factors that
cause the decline in knowledge and application of Pancasila values
among students, it must be explored more deeply to find the best
solution for strengthening the Pancasila ideology among students.
(Alouw et al., 2021). However, the use of Pancasila and Religion
education is intended to raise the humanistic element, whether as
a Pancasila human or religious person (Widodo & Muchtar, 2020).
Therefore, the curriculum must also prioritize value education for
students, so that they can live up to the values of Pancasila and
Religion within themselves, so that they can choose and determine
what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad and
what is fair and what is unfair (Sari, 2013).
Value Education is a process, which begins at home and con-
tinues in society and in formal educational institutions (Duban &
Aydoğdu, 2016). Education itself essentially functions to prepare
students to become individuals who have knowledge, skills, atti-
tudes, values, and behaviors that have a positive impact on students’
lives in society (Katilmis, 2017). Currently the curriculum must also
prioritize value education for students, so that they can maintain
the values in themselves, can determine what is right and what is
wrong, which is good and which is bad and which is fair and which
is unfair (Aneja, 2014). Value education can be instilled in students
in various ways, but the main purpose of value education in formal
educational institutions is that the students can understand and im-
plement the values were taught to them in their daily behavior andattitudes; and they can contribute to society through social respon-
sibility and good attitudes. In the case of value education at Bina
Nusantara University, it means that students can understand and
implement core values, namely SPIRIT (Striving for the excellence,
Perseverance, Innovation, Respect, Integrity, and Team-Work) at
Bina Nusantara University (Benawa, 2019).
Based on that phenomenon, this research aimed to reveal the
significance of Pancasila education and Religion Education on the
Value Education of the students referring to the Bina Nusantara
University core values, which well known as SPIRIT.
2 LITERATURE REVIEW
Pancasila education is a reflection of character education to build
the identity of the Indonesian nation as a large, modern, dignified
and civilized nation (Martoredjo, 2016) & (Amir, 2013). Pancasila
as the ideology of the Indonesian nation is a guideline for Indone-
sian people in acting in everyday life (Manurung & Monny, 2021).
and (Jannah & Pahlevi, 2018). The integrity of students is also in-
creasingly formed by participating in Pancasila Education learning
through habituation and example. Habituation of learning activities
and role models also come from the teacher concerned.
The implementation of religious education is a compulsory cur-
riculum subject that must be implemented in every educational
unit as stated in the 2007 National Education System Law. Reli-
gion education is expected to produce young people who have
noble character, faith and become strong human beings in facing
challenges and obstacles as well as changes that arise in social in-
teraction. According to Eniwati Khaidir & Fitriah M. Suud (2020),
Religion Education is education to foster students’ physical and
spiritual as well as the formation of students’ personalities. He
concluded that Religion Education is a complete process carried out
in order to realize a complete human being who believes and fears
to God Almighty. From this formulation there are noble values in
the form of spiritual values, humanity, personality so that all of
them prepare students to become good human beings and have
moral values that are embraced in their lives in society. So, Religion
Education also serves as a barrier in students doing bad things in
their lives.
By holding Religion Education at Bina Nusantara University
which is packaged in Religion Character Building, it is intended
that students are helped in building their spirituality. Thus, it is also
hoped that through religion education, students are expected to
truly appreciate the substance of their religion and do not fall into
a religious appreciation that emphasizes mere formality, but truly
believes and religious. By returning to the substance of religion,
students’ religious morality becomes a form of their faith, because
surely the implication of faith is moral.
Value education is education that aims to help students under-
stand, realize and experience values, so that students are able to live
them integrally in their life. So, the orientation of value education
is to guide the conscience of students to develop more positively
gradually and continuously, as well as to instill values, so that stu-
dents are able to transform themselves and internalize the values
within themselves.
Value education orientation is the same as moral education. Both
are committed to the steps that students must take in order to have

the values and virtues that will shape them into good human beings,
allowing them to be able to make responsible decisions about the
problems of their lives. If the value education is successful, then
physical supervision is not necessary, because everyone already has
a supervisor who oversees all his behavior, he will automatically
do the best for himself and others.
Value education prepares students’ needs to excel in a competi-
tive world and the need for compassion for others (Indrani, 2012)
& (Singh, 2011). Value education plays a role in assessing value
criteria consisting of awareness, emotion, joy and integration of
individual behavior, in accordance with the main purpose of value
education, namely to instill good behavior, so that it becomes per-
manent behavior in students’ daily lives. In the context of Bina
Nusantara University, these values are condensed into 6 distinctive
core values, namely SPIRIT. SPIRIT is an abbreviation of Striving
for excellence, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect, Innovation, and
Teamwork (Benawa & Lake, 2019). SPIRIT should be applied by all
the lectures and also the students of Bina Nusantara University.
3 METHOD
This study used a simple quantitative method using 150 students as
respondents with simple random sampling. The 150 respondents
were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding the three variables,
namely Pancasila Education, Religion Education and Value Educa-
tion. Questionnaire about the three variables. using a Likert scale
with options such as (1) Strongly disagree; (2) disagree; (3) Slightly
disagree; (4) Agree; (5) Strongly Agree. The questionnaire for the
first variable, namely Pancasila Education consists of 29 questions,
the second variable for Religion Education consists of 33 questions,
and the third variable Value Education consists of 42 questions.
After the data was collected, the data were analyzed using path
analysis with SPSS 22 software to determine the magnitude of the
influence of Pancasila Education (X 1) and Religion Education (X 2)
on Value Education (X 3).
4 RESULTS
To ensure that the results of this study have met the requirements
for conducting path analysis, namely that the data are normally dis-
tributed, linear regression, and significant regression, the following
shows the fulfillment of these three conditions.
4.1 Testing of Normality
From the table 1 about test of normality above, it is known that the
three variables are normally distributed, because the significancevalue in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov column is greater (>) than 0.050,
such as X 1(Pancasila Education) is 0.200*; X 2(Religion Education)
is 0.200*; and X 3(Value Education) is 0.072.
4.2 Result Test of Linearity
There is information, that if the value of Deviation from Linearity
Sig > 0.05, there is a significant linear relationship between the
independent variable and the dependent variable. On other hand,
if the value of Deviation from Linearity Sig <0.05, then there is no
significant linear relationship between the independent variable
and the dependent variable.
From the table 2 above, the Deviation from Linearity Sig value
is obtained of 0.503 is greater than 0.05. So, it can be concluded
that there is a significant linear relationship between the Pancasila
Education variable (X 1) and the Value Education variable (X 3).
From the table 3 above, the Deviation from Linearity Sig value
is obtained of 0.178 is greater than 0.05. So, it can be concluded
that there is a significant linear relationship between the Religion
Education variable (X 2) and the Value Education variable (X 3).
4.3 Result Test of Significancy
There is information, if the significance value (Sig) is smaller (<)
than the 0.05 probability, it means that there is an effect of X 1on
X3. On the other hand, if the significance value (Sig) is greater (>)
than the probability of 0.05, it means that there is no effect of X 1
on X 3.
Based on table 4 above, it is known that the significance value
(Sig) of 0.000 is smaller than the probability of 0.05, so it can be
concluded that H 0is rejected and H 1is accepted which means that
there is a significant effect of X 1on X 3.
Based on the table 5 above, it is known that the significance
value (Sig) of 0.021 is smaller than the probability of 0.05, so it can
be concluded that H 0is rejected and H 1is accepted which means
that there is an effect of X 2on X 3.
More deeply, the test results are known based on the coefficients
model, as below.
Based on the results of the data processing above, a structural
equation can be made as follows:
X3=0.265X 1+0.146X 2+€1
The equation showed the magnitude of the direct effect of variables
X1and X 2on X 3together, which X 1variable is 0.265 and X 2is
0.146 or a total of 41.1%. This means that the two variables as a
whole have not been able to explain the X 3variable, because just

only 41.1% and there are more than 50 percent that influence value
education, which in this study is not discussed.
So, the relationship between variables is clear, namely that between
the independent variables and the dependent variable there is a
relationship in the form of a significant influence on the dependent
variable, whether variable 1 is greater than variable 2 or vice versa
as produced in this study. The reason is that the two variables are
indeed oriented to the cultivation of value education, which in the
case of Bina Nusantara University is manifested in the core values
of SPIRIT which stands for Striving for the excellence, Perseverance,
Integrity, Respect, Innovation, and Team work.
5 DISCUSSION
It seems that the impact of Pancasila Education and Religion Educa-
tion is less significant in line with the findings of research conducted
in recent years which showed a lack of student interest in Pancasila
and Religion Subjects (Amir, 2013). Meanwhile, other researchers
observed that the attitudes of some students did not seem to apply
the values of Pancasila and Religion in their life. Therefore, it is
very necessary that Pancasila Education and Religion Education be
taught at the school and college level (Jannah & Pahlevi, 2018).The fact that there is a decline in the knowledge and appreciation
of Pancasila Education and Religion Education among the students
must be explored for the various factors causing it to find the
best solution to restrengthen the knowledge and appreciation of
Pancasila Education and Religion Education among the students.
Sunarto argued that the fact of the decline in interest is closely
related to developments or changes that showed the way a person
behaves and interacts with his environment (Sunarto & Hartono,
2002). The interaction he meant involves behavioral responses that
depend on stimuli in the environment. Considering that human
development starts from preadolescence then adolescence and con-
tinues until the adult stage, that is what can cause changes in
student interest in Pancasila Education and Religion Education, be-
cause at every stage of human development there are moral values
that underlie every behavior. Therefore, Pancasila Education and
Religion Education must be a process of developing the potential
of students in the context of realizing human beings who believe
and fear God, so that their behavior is always based on certain
moral values according to the religion education he received. He
is expected to be a human with noble character, independent and
responsible for himself, the nation and the state.
Based on his research Mohamad Dzofir (2020) concluded that
there were changes and progress in students’ religious behavior,
such as in terms of students’ religious commitment, growing so-
cial concern for others and obedience in maintaining social ethics,
able to internalize the values of Religion Education that they be-
lieve in, so that the motivation appears to practice them in real life.
Meanwhile, Mukhtaruddin (2011) concluded that there were differ-
ences in religious behavior among students who received religious
lessons.
From the results of his research, Muzakir (2016) concluded that
the application of character development in instilling religious
values has a good impact on students. Thus, it can be concluded
that character building can be done through inculcating religious

values in students, such as honesty, respect for older people; be

Meanwhile, Viktorias Res, Sarah Emanuel and Rina Wijayanti
(2021) concluded that online faith-building activities have a positive
effect on children’s religious and moral values education.
6 CONCLUSION
From the results of the research above can be concluded that Value
Education including Core Values at Bina Nusantara University is
influenced by Pancasila Education and Religion Education, although
there are other factors that also influence it. Therefore, although the
compulsory curriculum courses, in this case Pancasila Education
and Religion Education have significant effect, but there are other
factors that influence Value Education. That is, in terms of formal
education alone will not be enough to instill values, so besides
formal education is still influenced by non-formal education.
Hopefully this conclusion triggers the world of education to
accelerate changes in innovation and creativity in terms of systems,
methods, and learning content, so that Value Education continues to
be built among the students, especially through Pancasila Education
and Religion Education without exclude the non formal education
factors.
7 RECOMMENDATION
Based on the conclusions above, some recommendations can be
conveyed as follows:
First, it is recommended for students to increase their aware-
ness of values by drawing inspiration about the beliefs of Religion
Education that are accepted or learned.
Second, it is also recommended for the students to be more con-
cerned about students’ awareness of values, especially values that
they have learned from Pancasila Education, so that the students
can improve not only their understanding but also their implemen-
tation in their life.Third, for the researchers this result can be used as an opportu-
nity to develop this research related to, for example, which variables
have a more significant impact or influence or contribution to value
education today where learning is more nuanced online or distance
learning.
8 LIMITATION
This research has many limitations; First, from the aspect of samples
and variables that do not reach all of them. Value education is
proven not only determined by formal education, moreover it is
limited to Pancasila education and religion education. In terms
of formal education alone, there are still many variables that can
contribute to value education.
Second, as well as in terms of non-formal education, there are
still many variables that can be studied, which are the variables that
make a major contribution to value education, especially during
the COVID-19 pandemic where the majority of learning is still
held online with all the technical and non-technical problems that
accompany it.
