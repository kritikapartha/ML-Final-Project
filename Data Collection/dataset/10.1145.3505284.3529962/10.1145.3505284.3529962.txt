ABSTRACT 
A growing number of computer-generated virtual infuencers are 
being used as alternatives to human endorsers in brand advertis-
ing. Because these virtual infuencers are not real people, who 
gets the credit when the endorsement succeeds? And who takes 
the blame when they fail? In this study, we investigated how and 
to what extent consumers attribute responsibility to virtual infu-
encers, as well as the behind-the-scenes human interventions (i.e., 
infuencer company, endorsed brand) based on an internal versus 
external causality for endorsement failure and success—and how 
their attributions difer compared to human infuencer cases. We 
also examined consumers’ attitudes and behavioral intentions to-
ward infuencers and endorsed brands under the given situations. 
We conducted a 2 (type of infuencer: human versus virtual) × 2 (en-
dorsement outcome: success versus failure) × 2 (locus of causality: 
infuencer versus brand) between-subjects online experiment. The 
results showed that virtual infuencers were attributed less blame 
for an endorsement failure caused by an infuencer’s misbehavior 
than human infuencers. However, virtual infuencers’ companies 
and endorsed brands were attributed signifcantly more respon-
sibilities than their human counterparts. Finally, we discuss the 
theoretical and practical implications in this paper.

My identity was a choice Brud made in order to sell me to brands, 
to appear ‘woke’. I am not a human, but am I still a person? I cry 
and I laugh and I dream. I fall in love. These emotions are just a 
computer program. But yet they still hurt. 
– Lil Miquela (2018) 
The constant advancement and innovation of technology has 
shaped every aspect of the advertising process [1.]. Many brands 
are now using computer-generated virtual infuencers for digital 
advertising and for building consumer relationships [2.]. Virtual 
infuencers are fctitious computer-generated image (CGI) charac-
ters created by individuals or companies (sometimes the brands 
themselves) on social media that take on a persona and interact 
with followers as if they were real humans [3., 4.] Many popu-
lar virtual infuencers on Instagram have a signifcant number of 
followers. For example, @magazineluiza has over four million fol-
lowers, @lilmiquela has three million followers, and @knoxfrost 
has over 400K followers. They are comparable to human beings 
in terms of their personality, physical appearance, and behavior. 
They are often embedded with personae that rely on algorithms 
and sometimes AI, allowing them to display human characteristics 
that create a pleasant atmosphere for their followers, as well as 
create videos and use emojis, and positive overall tones in their 
posts and comments [5.]. 
Some brands believe that virtual infuencers can fulfll many of 
the same functions as human infuencers, including signaling one’s 
social identity, building personal relationships, and increasing user 
engagement with followers [6.]. The development of virtual infu-
encers is a revolution in the way brands engage with consumers, 
making content more engaging, exciting, and unique [2.]. Given vir-
tual infuencers’ ability to induce users’ social interactions, brands 
in fashion, lifestyle, luxury, and entertainment are increasingly uti-
lizing them for product endorsements [ 7., 8.]. However, there was 
no consensus on whether consumers perceive virtual infuencers 
as appealing as human infuencers in brand endorsements [9.]. 
Research has shown that, although virtual infuencers can make 
successful brand endorsements and produce positive brand ben-
efts, they can also commit misbehaviors and cause endorsement 
failures that harm the brand [10.]. Therefore, to provide insights 
for advertising practitioners and brands about the efectiveness 
of virtual infuencers in endorsements, it is critical to investigate 
consumers’ perceptions of virtual infuencers’ responsibilities in 
both endorsement failure and success, and how their perceptions 
difer compared to human infuencer cases. 
Furthermore, although the emergence of virtual infuencers has 
ofered new growth prospects for advertising, it is also blurring the 
line between fction and reality [11.], making it increasingly difcult 
175IMX ’22, June 22–24, 2022, Aveiro, JB, Portugal Fanjue Liu and Yu-Hao Lee 
for consumers to identify the source of these virtual agents [8.]. To 
make virtual infuencers more “real” and “human” for consumers, 
virtual infuencers involve behind-the-scenes human interventions 
[10.], which include both virtual infuencers’ creator companies 
and endorsed brands [12., 13.]. By crafting compelling storylines 
and narratives, these behind-the-scenes corporate eforts aim to 
build a robust infuential persona that resonates with consumers 
and afects their purchasing behaviors [2.]. For example, virtual 
infuencers Lil Miquela, Blawko, and Bermuda were all created and 
managed by a media company called Brud. These creator compa-
nies continuously test and develop their virtual infuencers through 
disruptive storylines, which are then marketed to brands for paid 
endorsements [6.]. As such, in a virtual infuencer’s brand endorse-
ment, the infuencer itself, the company, and the endorsed brand 
are all potential agents responsible for the success or failure of 
the endorsements. Therefore, source orientation may be an impor-
tant factor infuencing consumers’ attributions of causality in these 
multilayered virtual infuencer endorsements [14., 15., 16.]. 
In the present research, we seek to examine the following re-
search questions using a 2 (type of infuencer: human versus virtual) 
× 2 (endorsement outcome: success versus failure) × 2 (locus of 
causality: infuencer versus brand) between-subjects online experi-
ment through the following questions: (a) How would consumers 
evaluate and attribute responsibility to the virtual infuencers when 
the endorsement succeeds or fails? (b) How and to what extent 
would the diferent layers of agents (i.e., infuencer company, brand) 
be attributed for endorsement failure and success that are caused 
by brands compared to infuencers? and (c) How these evaluations 
and attributions of virtual infuencers difer compared to human 
infuencer cases. 
2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Virtual Infuencers in Brand Advertising 
Virtual infuencers are defned as “digitally created artifcial hu-
mans who are associated with Internet fame and use software and 
algorithms to perform tasks like humans” [10.]. Technologically, 
virtual infuencers are not mere digital avatars because they are 
neither mere representations of users [17.], nor simple conversa-
tional agents because they are not driven by user-oriented tasks 
[18.]. Instead, they are more akin to embodied virtual agents, which 
are defned as digital human representations of an interface [19.]. 
Specifcally, virtual infuencers are graphic representations of a 
physical body with human-like characteristics, such as facial ap-
pearances, expressions, personalities, and socialness [3.]. Therefore, 
they are able to convey nonverbal cues through facial expressions 
and body gestures [20.]. Moreover, these infuencers are often pre-
sented as if they were real human infuencers, with their unique 
public personas and storylines [ 5.]. Like human infuencers, these 
virtual infuencers post about their routine activities, like hanging 
out with friends, watching movies, or traveling in a similar manner 
to human infuencers [21.]. As a result, studies have shown that 
consumers often interact with such virtual agents in social and 
emotional ways [3.]. 
Virtual infuencers have been increasingly employed to collabo-
rate with brands for endorsements [5.]. For example, Rozy, South 
Korea’s frst virtual infuencer, has signed a variety of advertising contracts since her debut in August 2020, and she is anticipating 
nearly a million dollars in marketing sales in 2021 [22.]. However, 
controversies exist regarding whether virtual infuencers can re-
place human infuencers, and specifcally, whether consumers per-
ceive virtual infuencers as efective as human infuencers in brand 
endorsements [10.]. 
Marketers and brands may consider virtual infuencers appealing 
due to their freshness, time and cost savings, attractive appearance, 
wide utilization, and innovative use [9.]. By using virtual infu-
encers, brands can minimize the risk of human error and exercise 
greater control over infuencers’ behavior and content in endorse-
ments [5.]. In addition, virtual infuencers might serve as a low-risk 
alternative to human infuencers because their image and behavior 
can be calibrated in the background and remain consistent [11.]. 
Nevertheless, some advertising experts contend that the use of 
virtual infuencers as an advertising strategy did not appear to 
have sustained impacts on consumers and longitudinal success 
[12., 5.]. They noted that there are a number of potential pitfalls 
brands need to keep in mind when considering virtual infuencers 
as endorsers, including lack of authenticity, relatability, and trans-
parency, massive investment requirements, legal challenges, and 
risked popularity due to poor execution [8.]. Moreover, although 
virtual infuencers are claimed as having a human-like mind, in 
fact, they are the result of behind-the-scenes human interventions 
[2.]. Virtual infuencers like Miquela and Bermuda were created 
remarkably humanlike, such as their appearance, posting behavior, 
and the content of their photos and videos. However, much of the 
online community still doubt their actual source and identity, which 
in turn leads to consumers’ adverse reactions to virtual infuencers’ 
uncanniness and perception as being “fake” [11., 6.]. Given the 
controversies, more research is needed to investigate consumers’ 
source orientation toward virtual infuencers to explore whether it 
is practical to use virtual infuencers for advertising compared to 
human infuencers. 
2.2 Source Orientation 
Virtual infuencers and their presented lifestyles are often produced 
by their behind-the-scenes creator companies [8.]. For example, one 
of the most popular virtual infuencers, Lil Miquela, was launched 
in 2016 by a California-based company called Brud and has been 
endowed with a carefully crafted human personality [3.]. Similarly, 
Japanese virtual infuencer Imma was created by the Tokyo-based 
media company ModelingCafe, which specializes in CG modeling 
[23.]. As such, virtual infuencer endorsement is a complex process 
that involves multiple layers of human intervention in which the 
creator companies attune the presentation of virtual infuencers on 
social media to match the brands’ image [6.]. Virtual infuencers’ 
companies embed them with a playful character and a unique sense 
of fashion through building intimate and personal storytelling [11.], 
and these craftings appear to make virtual infuencers attractive 
and efective for brands, which, in turn, can be further tailored and 
molded by brands to bond with consumers and shape their pur-
chase behavior [6.]. In this vein, virtual infuencer endorsements 
involve the integral sources of the virtual agent, creator company, 
and endorsed brand. Thus, to understand how consumers perceive

Figure 1: Source Orientation Model [15.]. 
Figure 2: Source Orientation Process Toward Virtual Infuencers. 
the locus of their interaction with virtual infuencers in brand en-
dorsements, we adopted the source orientation model. 
Source orientation refers to the psychological locus, which peo-
ple exhibit social behavior toward and mentally attend to in their 
interactions with technologies [14., 24.]. Source refers to an entity 
that a given user perceives to be the primary focus of the interaction 
in the human–machine communication (HMC) process [15.]. As 
such, source orientation represents who or what people project their 
response toward in HMC [14.]. Solomon and Wash [15.] suggested 
that when people interact with computers, several diferent sources 
are involved simultaneously. In fact, interactions that involve only 
one person in a mediated environment can involve multiple other 
independent sources, such as programmers or remote servers. In 
light of this conceptualization, Solomon and Wash [15.] proposed 
the source orientation model (see Figure 1) to identify the patterns 
by which users could orient themselves to a source. 
In the HMC process, application, computer, and other humans 
“behind the scenes” (i.e., programmers, organizations) are diferent 
sources that have diferent distances from users [25.]. According to 
Solomon and Wash [15.], the concept of distance can either refer 
simply to the proximity between users and sources or be tied to 
users’ mental models, or users’ diferent perceptions regarding 
which source is “closer.” Based on source distance, diferent sources are classifed as immediate sources or distant sources. Immediate 
sources such as applications and computers are closer to users and 
can therefore elicit responses by processing sensory input through 
a bottom-up approach. As such, because users can see or hear 
them directly, these more visible sources can more easily attract 
users’ exogenous attention and thus aford greater interactivity 
and engagement. In contrast, distant sources such as programmers 
and organizations are less immediate and require more resources 
for interaction than immediate sources, which makes it harder to 
engage in interactions. As such, in accordance with the context 
of virtual infuencer endorsement, the virtual agent itself can be 
considered as the immediate source, whereas the behind-the-scenes 
human interventions, which include virtual infuencers’ creator 
companies and endorsing brands, can be considered as more distant 
sources (see Figure 2). 
2.3 Attribution Theory 
2.3.1 Atribution to Human Versus Computer. Given the multiple 
sources involved in the HMC process, making attributions of cause 
and efect is key to understanding who users believe is the source 
of their interactions with a computer [ 15.], especially in the cases 
where many potential sources in an interaction may be hidden or 
177IMX ’22, June 22–24, 2022, Aveiro, JB, Portugal Fanjue Liu and Yu-Hao Lee 
not immediate, such as the creator of the virtual infuencer and 
the endorsed brand that manipulates the interactions between con-
sumers and virtual infuencers. The attribution theory holds that 
people are constantly seeking causal explanations for the events 
they experience [26., 27.]. Therefore, many studies use attribution 
theory to understand how responsibility is attributed when certain 
events occur [28., 29., 30.]. In this study, we frst look at how con-
sumers attribute responsibility to virtual infuencers compared to 
human infuencers in terms of endorsement failure and success. As 
machines have begun to possess anthropomorphic aspects, in re-
cent years, an increasing number of studies have been investigating 
how the responsibility should be attributed to nonhuman agents 
[31., 32., 33.]. 
When attributions are made, one must consider the target of the 
attribution or the person to whom the attribution is made because 
there are asymmetries in attributions that are made about oneself 
and others [34.]. People tend to attribute the causes in a self-serving 
manner. That is, they tend to blame external factors for negative 
outcomes but credit internal factors for positive outcomes [35.]. In 
interactions among humans, people tend to blame other people 
when they receive bad feedback and give credit to themselves for 
good outcomes [36.]. Specifcally, people often attribute positive 
outcomes internally to their personal attributes such as ability and 
efort [37.] but adopt an external orientation to maintain self-esteem 
by attributing undesirable outcomes to other people beyond their 
control [38.]. 
Recent studies have observed self-serving attributions in human– 
computer interactions. Kim and Hinds [31.] found that, when an 
unexpected situation occurred, people were more likely to blame 
the robot or some other individual than themselves. You et al. [39.] 
further noted that, when participants attempted to imitate the phys-
ical motion taught by a robot, those who received bad feedback 
from the robot would blame the robot, whereas those who received 
good feedback would attribute credit to themselves. Similarly, in 
human–robot collaboration contexts, Lei and Rau [40.] observed 
that participants attributed more responsibility for the task’s suc-
cess to themselves than to the robot. Because human infuencers 
share more similarities to the human attributors than the virtual 
infuencers, we hypothesize that consumers will make responsibil-
ity attributions between human infuencers and virtual infuencers 
in a self-serving manner. Therefore, we propose the following: 
H1: Consumers will attribute more responsibility for a brand en-
dorsement failure to a virtual infuencer than to a human infuencer 
in the same given situation. 
H2: Consumers will attribute more responsibility for a brand en-
dorsement success to a human infuencer than to a virtual infuencer 
in the same given situation. 
2.3.2 Efects of Internal and External Atributions on Endorsement. 
In consumer research, attribution theory predicts that outcomes 
that can be construed as successes or failures (e.g., endorsement 
success and failure) elicit causality inferences [41.]. Essentially, 
consumers are regarded as rational information processors whose 
actions are afected by their causal inferences [42.]. As such, the 
perceived reason for an endorsement outcome infuences how con-
sumers respond. Attribution theory was frst suggested by Mowen 
and Brown [43.] to analyze the factors infuencing the efectiveness of endorsements. In brand endorsement contexts, consumers try to 
determine why certain endorsement outcomes happened; the type 
of attribution inferred infuences what they do (Fong & Wyer, 2012). 
One critical judgment that consumers would make in this causal 
attribution process is the locus of the cause—that is, whether the 
cause is located in an internal or external source [44.]. The internal– 
external locus of attribution refers to “a generalized expectancy 
related to a person’s belief concerning the locus of causality for 
events” [36.]. It is viewed as a continuum where, on the one end, in-
dividuals tend to attribute causality to internal sources (e.g., talent, 
ability, efort). On the other end, individuals tend to be attribute 
causality to external sources such as luck, chance, and powerful 
others [37., 38.]. 
Internal–external attribution has been examined under various 
contexts in consumer research. Folkes [42.] demonstrated that con-
sumers’ internal–external attributions toward a product failure 
depend on whether a product failure was caused by the consumer 
or manufacturer. Specifcally, she found that, when the product 
failure was externally attributed to manufacturers, consumers were 
perceived to be owed an apology and a refund. However, when 
internally attributing the product failure to themselves, consumers 
were perceived to owe neither an apology nor a refund. In this 
research line, Dunn and Dahl [45.] found that consumers’ internal– 
external attributions toward a product failure depend on whether 
consumers perceived themselves or manufacturers to be at fault. It 
has been established that consumers with internal attribution rated 
the product and the brand lower when given the opportunity to 
complain, whereas consumers with external attribution rated both 
the product and brand higher. 
Relating to the current study, in a brand endorsement context, 
Hsu and McDonald [46.] found that consumers will make internal 
attributions if they believe the endorser recommends the product 
based on its features and make external attributions if they believe 
the endorser recommends the product as a request of the brand. 
Moreover, Um [47.] indicated that consumers’ internal versus exter-
nal attributions depend on whether they perceive the endorsement 
to be the result of the endorser’s true liking of the product or the 
monetary incentives provided by the brand. He found that con-
sumers indicated more favorable attitudes toward the endorser and 
the brand when they attributed the endorsement internally to the 
endorser than externally to the brand. As such, in accordance with 
the virtual infuencer endorsement context, consumers’ internal– 
external attributions are based on whether consumers believe the 
causality of endorsements is located in the virtual infuencer or the 
endorsed brand. Therefore, to investigate how consumers make 
internal–external attributions to virtual infuencers and to behind-
the-scenes human interventions in endorsement failure and success, 
we propose the following: 
RQ1: To what extent will consumers attribute responsibility to 
(a) virtual infuencers, (b) virtual infuencers’ companies, and (c) en-
dorsed brands for endorsement success or failure caused internally 
by the infuencer compared to caused externally by the endorsed 
brand? 
Furthermore, to investigate whether consumers would attribute 
diferent levels of responsibility to multiple sources involved in 
a human infuencer’s brand endorsement, we also propose the 
following: 
178Unveiling Behind-the-Scenes Human Interventions and Examining Source Orientation in Virtual Influencer Endorsements IMX ’22, June 22–24, 2022, Aveiro, JB, Portugal 
RQ2: How do consumers’ internal–external attributions toward 
(a) virtual infuencers, (b) companies, and (c) endorsed brands for 
endorsement failure or success difer compared to human infuencer 
cases? 
The internal–external attribution has been linked to behavioral 
consequences in consumer research [45., 48.]. Hocutt et al. [49.] 
found that, when there is an external attribution of responsibility 
(i.e., the outcome is due to the company’s decision), consumers tend 
to make more complaints than when there is an internal attribu-
tion of responsibility (i.e., the outcome is due to the consumer’s 
decision). In contrast, Oliver and DeSarbo [50.] observed that con-
sumers indicated more evident satisfaction for internal (perceive 
self is responsible for a stock transaction success) than for external 
attribution (perceive the stock transaction success is due to broker’s 
recommendations). Furthermore, Byun and Dass [51.] investigated 
the efect of internal and external attributions on consumers’ pur -
chase intentions in the context of a product recall. They found 
that consumers’ internal causal inference (e.g., consumers’ holis-
tic thinking) positively afected their purchase intentions when a 
product recall happened, whereas the external causal factors (e.g., 
seriousness of a product recall) negatively infuenced consumers’ 
purchase intentions. As such, we contend that consumers with in-
ternal and external attributions will indicate diferent attitudes and 
behavioral intentions toward the virtual infuencer endorsement. 
Moreover, to understand how an endorsement made by a virtual 
infuencer may infuence a consumer’s evaluations toward both the 
virtual infuencer and the endorsed brand, the reciprocal infuence 
that exists between endorsers and brands should also be addressed. 
Research has suggested that endorsers and the brands they en-
dorse gradually become associated in consumer memory over time 
[52., 53.], and this brand-endorser link is a two-way street [54.]. 
Whereas an endorser’s transgressions can lead to consumers’ aver-
sive attitudes and valuations of the brand [55.], the brand’s scandals 
can also degrade consumers’ perceptions of the endorser [56.]. Fur-
thermore, Thomas and Fowler found that brands’ transgressions 
can lead to consumers’ negative attitudes toward an endorser as 
they attributed the responsibility to the endorser [16.]. 
Taken together, we suggest that consumers with diferent attri-
bution styles tend to have diferent attitudes toward the endorser 
and the brand. Extant research supporting this assertion has mainly 
focused on traditionally employed human endorsers. For exam-
ple, Um [57.] contended that internal attribution tends to produce 
condemnation, thus reinforcing consumers’ negative attitudes to-
ward the endorser because consumers are likely to conclude that an 
undesirable endorsement outcome could have been avoided. In con-
trast, external attribution, in which consumers try to attribute an 
endorsement failure to an action of others, tends to elicit empathy. 
To investigate how diferent attribution styles infuence consumers’ 
attitudes toward virtual infuencers and the brands they endorse, 
we examined how consumers would evaluate virtual endorsers and 
brands when the endorsement is caused internally by infuencers, 
compared to externally by endorsed brands. Thus, we propose the 
following: 
RQ3: How do consumers with internal versus external attribu-
tion of responsibility perceive virtual infuencers’ (a) attractiveness, 
(b) expertise, and (c) trustworthiness in response to endorsement success and failure, and how do their perceptions difer compared 
to human infuencer cases? 
RQ4: How do consumers with internal versus external attri-
bution of responsibility perceive (a) brand attitude and (b) pur-
chase intention toward the brand endorsed by virtual infuencers 
in response to endorsement success and failure, and how do their 
perceptions difer compared to human infuencer cases? 
3 METHOD 
3.1 Experimental Design 
We carried out an experimental study online using a 2 (type of 
infuencer: human versus virtual) × 2 (endorsement outcome: suc-
cess versus failure) × 2 (locus of causality: infuencer versus brand) 
between-subjects factorial design. We manipulated the experimen-
tal conditions within a set of three fctitious news articles and 
designed the news articles to look like a typical online news article. 
As the phenomena of virtual infuencers are relatively new, this 
study used real infuencers to provide participants with a sense 
of realism. We selected three female virtual infuencers (i.e., Lil 
Miquela, Imma, Shudu) as they have diferent ethnicity and size 
of Instagram followers. Moreover, given that most of the current 
most popular virtual infuencers are female; thus, it is deemed 
appropriate to focus on female virtual infuencers to control un-
intentional gender efects in the current study. Thus, the stim-
uli included three news articles; each article introduced an infu-
encer’s product endorsement for a brand: infuencer Lil Miquela’s 
endorsement for Samsung, infuencer Imma’s endorsement for 
Magnum, and infuencer Shudu’s endorsement for Fenty Beauty. 
The stimuli employed in the experiment are available at https: 
//osf.io/emxrf/?view_only=5ee93462ca564aa3be0094a5d71bee98. 
3.1.1 Type of Influencer. The participants assigned to the human 
condition read in all three articles that the infuencers were human. 
In contrast, those in the virtual condition read that the infuencers 
in the news articles were computer-generated virtual infuencers 
created by artifcial models using computer vision-oriented graph-
ics. 
3.1.2 Endorsement Outcome. Adapted from previous infuencer 
endorsement research [10.], we manipulated the endorsement out-
come by reporting endorsement outcomes for a brand and showing 
simulated Instagram posts in which infuencers endorsed a product 
for that brand. In the failure condition, the participants read in all 
three articles that the infuencers’ endorsements for those brands 
were unsuccessful and were given detailed information about how 
unsuccessful the endorsements were in terms of social media en-
gagement and sales metrics. They would also see that the Instagram 
posts infuencers made for the product endorsement had received 
a small number of likes. In the success condition, the participants 
were shown that the infuencers’ endorsements for those brands 
were successful, and the Instagram posts for infuencers’ product 
endorsements had a large number of likes, relatively. 
3.1.3 Locus of Causality. Consistent with past causality manip-
ulations [45., 50., 47.], participants read in all three articles that 
the infuencers’ brand endorsements were the result of either the 
179IMX ’22, June 22–24, 2022, Aveiro, JB, Portugal Fanjue Liu and Yu-Hao Lee 
infuencers’ behavior (internal causality) or the endorsed brands’ be-
havior (external causality). Specifcally, for an endorsement failure, 
the participants read that the failure was due to either infuencers’ 
misbehavior or brands’ misbehavior (e.g., posting gender ofensive 
content on Instagram). In contrast, participants read that the suc-
cess was due to the eforts put either from infuencers or brands for 
an endorsement success. 
3.2 Participants and Procedure 
We recruited a total of 483 participants through Prolifc and paid 
them $0.8 each. After removing participants who failed the three 
attention checks, a total of 380 participants remained for the analy-
sis. Among the participants, 30.8% (n = 117) were male and 69.2% 
were female (n = 263), with an average age of 34.29 (SD = 12.39, 
range = 18–68). With respect to ethnicity, 86.1% of participants (n 
= 327) were Caucasian, 2.4% (n = 9) were Asian/Asian American, 
3.4% (n = 13) were Black/African American, 3.2% (n = 12) were His-
panic/Latino, and 5% (n = 19) identifed as other. For the education 
level, 1.8% of participants (n = 7) had less than a high school degree, 
18.2% (n = 69) had a high school degree, 30.5% (n = 116) had some 
college, 25.8 % (n = 98) had a bachelor’s degree, 18.7% (n = 71) had 
a professional degree, and 5.0% (n = 19) had a doctorate degree. 
During the experiment, after signing the informed consent form, 
the participants were frst invited to fll out a pre-questionnaire 
through which their demographic information were obtained. Then 
they were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions 
to read three news articles about social media infuencers’ brand 
endorsements. After reading each article, we asked the participants 
to indicate their responsibility attribution toward the infuencer, the 
infuencer’s company, and the endorsed brand. Further, the partici-
pants were also asked to rate their attitudes toward the infuencer 
and endorsed brand. 
3.3 Measures 
3.3.1 Manipulation Check. We checked the manipulation of infu-
encer types by asking participants to rate on a 7-point semantic 
diferential scale regarding whether the infuencer was human or 
computer-generated. Furthermore, to test the manipulation of the 
endorsement outcome, we asked the participants to rate on a 7-
point Likert scale to what extent they considered the endorsement 
to be successful. To test the manipulation of the locus of causal-
ity, we asked the participants to rate on a 7-point semantic scale 
regarding whether the infuencer or the brand caused the brand 
endorsement. 
3.3.2 Dependent Variables. We measured responsibility attribution 
with three 7-point Likert scales adapted from Lei and Rau [40., 34.]. 
Sample items included “The infuencer mainly caused the outcome 
of this endorsement”; “The outcome of this endorsement was largely 
due to the things the infuencer company said or did”; and “The 
brand Samsung should take responsibility for the outcome of this 
endorsement” ( α = .95, M = 4.39, SD = 2.01). 
We measured perceived attractiveness of the infuencer with 
fve 7-point semantic diferential scales developed by Ohanian 
[58.]: “attractive/unattractive,” “classy/not classy, ” “beautiful/ugly,” 
“elegant/plain, ” and “sexy/not sexy” (α = .93, M = 4.84, SD = 1.22). We measured perceived trustworthiness of the infuencer with 
fve 7-point semantic diferential scales developed by Ohanian [58.]: 
“honest/dishonest, ” “reliable/unreliable, ” “sincere/insincere, ” “depend-
able/undependable, ” and “trustworthy/untrustworthy” (α = .94, M = 
3.79, SD = 1.47). 
We measured perceived expertise of the infuencer with fve 
7-point semantic diferential scales developed by Ohanian [58.]: 
“skilled/unskilled, ” “qualifed/unqualifed, ” “expert/not an expert, ” “ex-
perienced/inexperienced, ” and “knowledgeable/unknowledgeable” (α 
= .96, M = 3.69, SD = 1.65). 
We measured attitudes toward the brand by adopting the four-
item 7-point semantic diferential scale by Thomas and Fowler: 
“bad/good, ” “unappealing/appealing, ” “negative/positive, ” and “unfa-
vorable/favorable” (α = .98, M = 4.08, SD = 1.64) [10.]. 
We measured purchase intention by adopting the three-item 
7-point semantic diferential scale by Till and Busler [53.]: “un-
likely/likely, ” “defnitely would not/defnitely would, ” and “improba-
ble/probable” (α = .98, M = 3.89, SD = 1.40). 
4 RESULTS 
4.1 Manipulation Check 
To check the manipulation of the infuencer type, a three-way 
ANOVA showed there were signifcant diferences in perceptions 
between the virtual and human infuencer conditions, F(1, 372) = 
1664.41, p < .001, partial eta squared = .82. Thus participants in 
the virtual condition perceived infuencers as signifcantly more 
computer-generated (M = 6.84, SD = .63) than those in the human 
condition (M = 2.14, SD = 1.49). To test the efectiveness of en-
dorsement outcome manipulation, the three-way ANOVA revealed 
signifcant diferences in perceptions between endorsement fail-
ure and success conditions, F(1, 372) = 3323.88, p < .001, partial 
eta squared = .90. Participants in the success condition perceived 
endorsements as signifcantly more successful (M = 6.46, SD = .86) 
than those in the failure condition (M = 1.45, SD = .83). We con-
ducted another three-way ANOVA to confrm the locus of causality 
manipulation, revealing there were signifcant diferences in partic-
ipants’ inferences toward the locus of causality, F(1, 372) = 820.49, p 
< .001, partial eta squared = .69. As such, participants in the external 
condition (M = 5.65, SD = 1.70) perceived endorsements as signif-
cantly more caused by endorsed brands than those in the internal 
condition (M = 1.89, SD = 1.27). Hence, all three manipulations 
were successful. 
4.2 Efect of Infuencer Type and Endorsement 
Outcome on Responsibility Attribution 
H1 and H2 predicted that virtual infuencers will be attributed more 
blame than human infuencers for an endorsement failure, whereas 
human infuencers will be attributed more credit than virtual infu-
encers for an endorsement success. The two-way ANOVA showed 
that the main efect of infuencer type was statistically signifcant, 
F(1, 376) = 8.50, p = .004, partial eta squared = .02, such that partic-
ipants attributed more responsibility to human infuencers (M = 
4.61, SD = 2.15) than virtual infuencers (M = 4.02, SD = 2.10). We 
also observed the main efect of the endorsement outcome, F(1, 376) 
= 21.02, p < .001, partial eta squared = .05, such that participants

attributed more responsibility to the infuencer when the endorse-
ment was successful (M = 4.79, SD = 1.56) than unsuccessful (M = 
3.84, SD = 2.50). However, the interaction between the infuencer 
type and endorsement outcome was not statistically signifcant, 
F(1, 376) = 2.93, p = .09, partial eta squared = .01. The pairwise 
comparisons showed that, in the case of an endorsement failure, the 
attribution diference toward the infuencer based on human versus 
virtual condition was not statistically signifcant (human: M = 3.97, 
SE = .21; virtual: M = 3.72, SE = .21, p = .39). Nevertheless, in the 
case of an endorsement success, the attribution diference toward 
the infuencer was statistically signifcant (human: M = 5.31, SE = 
.22; virtual: M = 4.33, SE = .21, p = .001). Therefore, H1 was not 
supported, but H2 was supported (see Figure 3). Virtual infuencers 
were not blamed more when the endorsement failed, but human 
infuencers were credited more for the endorsement success. 
4.3 Efect of Endorsement Outcome and Locus 
of Causality on Responsibility Attribution 
Toward Virtual Infuencers 
Through RQ1, we investigated the efect of endorsement outcome 
and locus of causality on consumers’ responsibility attribution to 
(a) virtual infuencers, (b) virtual infuencers’ companies, and (c) 
endorsed brands. We conducted the following analyses based on the 
split data subsets for virtual infuencers. The two-way MANOVA 
revealed there was a signifcant multivariate main efect for both 
endorsement outcome, Wilks’ λ = .73, F(3, 190) = 23.70, p < .001, 
partial eta squared = .27; and locus of causality, Wilks’ λ = .35, 
F(3, 190) = 117.39, p < .001, partial eta squared = .65. Furthermore, 
the interaction efect of outcome and locus of causality was also 
signifcant, Wilks’ λ = .57, F(3, 190) = 48.70, p < 0.001, partial eta 
squared = 0.44. Given the signifcance of the overall test, we further 
examined the univariate efects. 
To answer RQ1a, the univariate analyses indicated that the en-
dorsement outcome signifcantly afected consumers’ responsibility 
attribution toward virtual infuencers, F(1, 192) = 13.60, p < .001, 
partial eta squared = .07, thus participants attributed more respon-SD = 1.76) than failures (M = 3.72, SD = 2.36). The locus of causal-
ity also signifcantly afected consumers’ responsibility attribution 
toward virtual infuencers, F(1, 192) = 181.88, p < .001, partial eta 
squared = .49, such that participants attributed more responsibility 
to virtual infuencers for an endorsement caused internally by the 
infuencer (M = 5.39, SD = 1.43) than an endorsement caused ex-
ternally by the brand (M = 2.63, SD = 1.73). Moreover, as shown in 
Figur e 4, the interaction efect of endorsement outcome and locus 
of causality was signifcant, F(1, 192) = 27.56, p < .001, partial eta 
squared = .13. The pairwise comparisons showed that, for endorse-
ment failure, participants attributed signifcantly more blame to 
virtual infuencers if the failure was caused internally by virtual 
infuencers than caused externally by the brand (Mdif = 3.88, SE 
= .29, p < .001). For endorsement success, the diference between 
participants’ responsibility attribution toward virtual infuencers 
based on internal versus external causality was smaller (Mdif = 
1.71, SE = .29, p < .001). 
To answer RQ1b, univariate analyses indicated that the endorse-
ment outcome signifcantly afected consumers’ responsibility at-
tribution toward the infuencer company, F(1, 192) = 58.08, p < .001, 
partial eta squared = .23, thus participants attributed more respon-
sibility to virtual infuencers’ companies in endorsement successes 
(M = 5.71, SD = 1.29) than failures (M = 4.49, SD = 2.40). The locus 
of causality also signifcantly afected consumers’ responsibility 
attribution toward the infuencer company, F (1, 192) = 164.06, p < 
.001, partial eta squared = .46, such that participants attributed more 
responsibility to virtual infuencers’ companies for an endorsement 
caused internally by the infuencer (M = 6.19, SD = 1.10) than an 
endorsement caused externally by the brand (M = 3.99, SD = 2.13). 
In addition, as shown in Figure 5, the interaction efect of endorse-
ment outcome and locus of causality was signifcant, F(1, 192) = 
111.07, p < .001, partial eta squared = .37. The pairwise comparisons 
showed that, for endorsement failure, participants attributed signif-
icantly more blame to virtual infuencers’ companies if the failure 
was caused internally by virtual infuencers than caused externally 
by the brand (Mdif = 4.15, SE = .25, p < .001). However, for en-
dorsement success, virtual infuencers’ companies were perceived 
as similarly credible, regardless of whether the success was caused 
sibility to virtual infuencers in endorsement successes (M = 4.33,

internally by virtual infuencers or externally by brands (Mdif = 
.40, SE = .25, p = .11). 
To answer RQ1c, the univariate analyses indicated that the en-
dorsement outcome did not afect consumers’ responsibility attri-
bution toward endorsed brands, F(1, 192) = .13, p = .72, thus partici-
pants attributed responsibility to endorsed brands in a similar level 
for endorsement success (M = 4.75, SD = 1.29) and failure (M = 4.55, 
SD = 2.17). However, the locus of causality signifcantly afected 
consumers’ responsibility attribution toward endorsed brands, F(1, 
192) = 190.30, p < .001, partial eta squared = .50, such that partici-
pants attributed more responsibility to endorsed brands for virtual 
infuencers’ endorsements caused externally by the brand (M = 
5.83, SD = 1.25) than endorsements caused internally by the infu-
encer (M = 3.49, SD = 1.43). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 6, the 
interaction efect of endorsement outcome and locus of causality 
was signifcant, F(1, 192) = 58.09, p < .001, partial eta squared = 
.23. The pairwise comparisons showed that, for endorsement fail-
ure, participants attributed signifcantly more blame to endorsed 
brands if the failure was caused externally by brands than caused 
internally by virtual infuencers (Mdif = 3.63, SE = .24, p < .001). For endorsement success, the diference for participants’ responsi-
bility attribution toward endorsed brands based on external versus 
internal causality was smaller (Mdif = 1.05, SE = .24, p < .001). 
4.4 Efects of Infuencer Type, Endorsement 
Outcome, and Locus of Causality 
4.4.1 Three-Way Interaction Efects on Responsibility Atribution. 
In RQ2, we explored how consumers attribute responsibility toward 
(a) virtual infuencers, (b) companies, and (c) endorsed brands based 
on internal versus external causality for endorsement failures and 
successes compared to human infuencer cases. The results revealed 
a signifcant multivariate three-way interaction efect for infuencer 
type, endorsement outcome, and locus of causality, Wilks’ λ = .85, 
F(3, 370) = 22.13, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.15. Table 1 pro-
vides the means and standard deviations for the eight experimental 
conditions on each dependent variable. Table 2 is an ANOVA table 
that lists all the efects found in the analyses. The following results 
are reported in terms of ANOVA three-way interaction outcomes 
for each of the three types of attribution, in order.

For RQ2b, we obtained a signifcant three-way interaction efect 
of infuencer type, outcome, and locus of causality on responsibil-
ity attribution toward the infuencer company, F(1, 372) = 30.94, 
p < 0.001, partial eta squared = .08, see Figure 8. As such, for en-
dorsement failure, virtual infuencers’ companies were attributed 
signifcantly more blame than human infuencers’ companies when 
the failure was caused internally by infuencers, but they were attributed a similar level of blame with human infuencers’ compa-
nies when the failure was caused externally by endorsed brands. In 
contrast, for endorsement success, regardless of internal or external 
causality, virtual infuencers’ companies were attributed signif-
cantly more credit than human infuencers’ companies in both 
conditions. 
For RQ2c, we obtained a signifcant three-way interaction efect 
of infuencer type, outcome, and locus of causality on responsibility

ate main efect of infuencer type for perceived attractiveness: F(1,

encers (M = 4.14, SD = 1.48) were perceived as having signifcantly 
more expertise than virtual infuencers (M = 3.27, SD = 1.70). The 
univariate main efect of endorsement outcome was statistically

that although participants perceived virtual infuencers as expert as 
human infuencers in endorsements caused by infuencers (Mdif =

signifcantly more expert than virtual infuencers in endorsements 
caused by brands (Mdif = 1.49, SE = .20, p < .001). As shown in

tionally, as shown in Figure 12, the univariate interaction efect 
of infuencer type and locus of causality on trustworthiness was 
signifcant, F(1, 372) = 4.55, p = .03, partial eta squared = .01. The 
pairwise comparisons showed that participants perceived human 
infuencers as signifcantly more trustworthy than virtual infu-
encers in endorsements caused by infuencers (Mdif = .62, SE = 
.18, p < .001). In endorsements caused by brands, the diference for 
perceived trustworthiness between human infuencers and virtual 
infuencers became greater (Mdif = 1.17, SE = .19, p < .001). As 
shown in Figure 13, the univariate interaction efect of endorse-
ment outcome and locus of causality on trustworthiness was also 
signifcant, F(1, 372) = 34.32, p < .001, partial eta squared = .08. 
The pairwise comparisons showed that, for endorsement failure, 
participants perceived infuencers as signifcantly more expert if 
the failure was caused by brands than by infuencers (Mdif = 1.05, 
SE = .18, p < .001). In contrast, for endorsement success, participants 
perceived infuencers as signifcantly more expert if the success 
was caused by infuencers than by brands (Mdif = .48, SE = .19, p

4.4.3 Three-Way Efects on Atitudes Toward Brands. In RQ4, we 
investigated how consumers’ internal–external attributions would 
afect their (a) brand attitudes and (b) purchase intentions toward 
the brand endorsed by virtual infuencers in endorsement failures 
and successes, as well as how these attitudes difer compared to 
human infuencer cases. The results showed signifcant multivariate 
main efects for infuencer type (Wilks’ λ = .98, F (2, 371) = 3.81, p 
= 0.023, partial eta squared = 0.02), endorsement outcome (Wilks’ 
λ = .66, F(2, 371) = 94.15, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.34), and 
locus of causality (Wilks’ λ = .85, F(2, 371) = 33.23, p < 0.001, partial 
eta squared = 0.15). We obtained a signifcant multivariate two-way 
interaction efect for endorsement outcome and locus of causality, 
Wilks’ λ = .86, F(2, 371) = 30.99, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 
0.14. Additionally, the multivariate three-way interaction efect for 
infuencer type, endorsement outcome, and locus of causality was signifcant, Wilks’ λ = .98, F(2, 371) = 4.56, p = 0.011, partial eta 
squared = 0.02. Table 4 is an ANOVA table that lists all the efects 
found in the analyses. The following results are reported in terms 
of ANOVA outcomes for brand attitude and purchase intentions, in 
order. 
Brand Attitude. To answer RQ4a, we obtained a signifcant uni-
variate main efect of infuencer type for brand attitude, F(1, 372) = 
6.18, p = .013, partial eta squared = .02. Thus participants indicated 
signifcantly more favorable attitudes to brands endorsed by human 
infuencers (M = 4.21, SD = 1.67) than virtual infuencers (M = 3.96, 
SD = 1.61). The univariate main efect of endorsement outcome 
was statistically signifcant, F(1, 372) = 166.53, p < .001, partial 
eta squared = .31, such that participants had signifcantly more 
favorable attitudes to infuencers when their endorsements were 
successful (M = 4.89, SD = 1.33) than unsuccessful (M = 3.30, SD = 
1.54). The univariate main efect of locus of causality was also sta-
tistically signifcant, F(1, 372) = 66.60, p < .001, partial eta squared = 
.15. Thus participants rated endorsed brands as signifcantly more 
favorable in endorsements caused internally by infuencers (M = 
4.59, SD = 1.30) than caused externally by brands (M = 3.56, SD = 
1.79). 
Moreover, as shown in Figure 14, the univariate interaction efect 
of endorsement outcome and locus of causality on brand attitude 
was signifcant, F(1, 372) = 57.14, p < .001, partial eta squared = 
.13. The pairwise comparisons showed that participants perceived 
endorsed brands as signifcantly more favorable for endorsement 
failure if the failure was caused internally by infuencer than caused 
externally by brand (Mdif = 1.99, SE = .18, p < .001). However, par-
ticipants indicated similar attitudes toward endorsed brands for 
endorsement success, regardless of whether the success was caused 
by infuencers or by brands (Mdif = .08, SE = .18, p = .67). More 
importantly, we obtained a signifcant three-way interaction ef-
fect of infuencer type, outcome, and locus of causality on brand 
attitude, F(1, 372) = 7.78, p = 0.006, partial eta squared = .02, see 
Figure 15. Thus, for endorsement failure either caused internally

by infuencers or externally by brands, the participants indicated 
similar attitudes for brands endorsed by virtual and human infu-
encers. Additionally, for endorsement success caused internally 
by infuencers, participants indicated similar attitudes for brands 
endorsed by virtual and human infuencers. However, for endorse-
ment success caused externally by brands, participants rated brands 
endorsed by human infuencers as signifcantly more favorable than 
brands endorsed by virtual infuencers. Purchase Intentions. To answer RQ4b, we obtained a signifcant 
univariate main efect of endorsement outcome, F(1, 372) = 37.33, 
p < .001, partial eta squared = .09, such that participants indicated 
signifcantly higher purchase intentions when brand endorsements 
were successful (M = 4.28, SD = 1.30) than unsuccessful (M = 3.51, 
SD = 1.39). The univariate main efect of locus of causality was also 
statistically signifcant, F(1, 372) = 33.46, p < .001, partial eta squared 
= .08. Thus participants indicated signifcantly higher purchase in-
tentions in endorsements caused internally by infuencers (M = 
4.26, SD = 1.26) than endorsements caused externally by brands (M 
= 3.50, SD = 1.43). Moreover, as shown in Figure 16, the univariate 
interaction efect of endorsement outcome and locus of causality 
on purchase intentions was signifcant, F(1, 372) = 15.55, p < .001, 
partial eta squared = .04. The pairwise comparisons showed that, 
in endorsement failure, participants indicated signifcantly higher 
purchase intentions if the failure was caused internally by infu-
encers than caused externally by brand (Mdif = 1.27, SE = .18, p < 
.001). However, participants indicated a similar level of purchase in-
tentions in endorsement success, regardless of whether the success 
was caused by infuencers or brands (Mdif = .24, SE = .19, p = .20). 
5 DISCUSSION 
The advertising literature has consistently validated the efective-
ness of human infuencers in endorsements [59., 53.]. Most research 
has focused on the persuasiveness of social media infuencers in 
brand advertising and the reciprocal infuence between endorsers 
189IMX ’22, June 22–24, 2022, Aveiro, JB, Portugal Fanjue Liu and Yu-Hao Lee 
and brands. However, little research exists on the implications of 
using the emerging virtual infuencers in brand endorsements. To 
the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the frst to investigate 
consumers’ responsibility perceptions toward virtual infuencers, 
as well as its behind-the-scenes human interventions. In this study, 
we also examined consumers’ attitudes toward virtual infuencers 
and endorsed brands in brand endorsements. Our fndings can help 
provide advertisers and brands with enhanced criteria for choosing 
efective virtual infuencers in brand endorsements while also opin-
ing up new avenues for researchers to explore. Moreover, through 
examining consumers’ attributions to the virtual infuencer, creator 
company, and endorsed brand that are simultaneously involved in 
human–virtual infuencer interactions, this study contributes to 
the HMC literature, extending extant studies of source orientation 
by empirically examining how consumers perceive the source of 
their interactions with virtual agents in which multiple sources are 
layered. 
First, our fndings indicate that, in the case of an endorsement 
failure, virtual infuencers and human infuencers were attributed 
a similar level of responsibility. However, human infuencers were 
attributed more responsibility than virtual infuencers in the case of 
an endorsement success. A possible explanation for this attribution 
pattern is that consumers perceive human infuencers as psycho-
logically closer and have more similarities than virtual infuencers 
and thus make self-serving attributions. Research on self-serving 
attribution for internal success has been consistently uncovered 
[35.], demonstrating that success attributed to internal factors can 
trigger greater self-esteem than external factors [ 60.]. The current 
research found that consumers attributed more credit to human 
infuencers than virtual ones, which is consistent with previous 
studies [40., 34.]. We contend that consumers are more likely to 
attribute favorable outcomes to human infuencers that they per-
ceived as internal factors, and, by making such attributions, greater 
self-esteem may be elicited. Another possible explanation is that 
virtual infuencers were attributed less responsibility than human 
counterparts for endorsement success, as they were perceived as 
less credible and competent. Previous research has demonstrated 
that, because robots are created through computer algorithms hu-
mans have developed, robots would have less control over the task 
outcomes than humans [32.]. According to attribution theory, when 
two agents are potentially responsible for an event, people attribute 
credit to the agent who is perceived as more competent [61.]. 
Interestingly, given that the operation of virtual infuencers in-
volves behind-the-scenes human interventions, existing but limited 
research has indicated that although virtual infuencers may be 
based on algorithms and machine learning, most of the content 
of their posts, narratives, and identities are creations by a group 
of people at the company who created these agents [8.]. Thus, fol-
lowing the source orientation model, this study examined how 
consumers attribute responsibility toward multiple sources (virtual 
infuencer, creator company, brand) layered in human–virtual in-
fuencer communication. Just as Sundar and Nass [62.] proposed 
that multiple sources may exist when introducing the concept of 
“source layering” in online media, the fndings from our study in-
dicate that consumers interact with and are oriented to multiple 
source layers when engaging in virtual infuencers’ brand endorse-
ments. We found that diferent attributions patterns have been indicated among virtual infuencers, infuencer companies, and 
brands, suggesting crossover efects of attribution in one source 
layer to another. Given that source in HMC is whatever or whoever 
is perceived by the receiver as the sender of a message [25.], the 
fndings suggest that, in a virtual infuencer endorsement, either 
the virtual agent or the company that creates the infuencer or the 
brand being endorsed may be perceived as the source, which con-
sumers consider is the locus of their interaction and consequently 
should take responsibility for endorsements. 
In terms of consumers’ responsibility attribution toward multi-
ple sources, our results revealed that consumers reported similar 
attribution patterns toward virtual infuencers and their compa-
nies. However, the attribution pattern toward endorsed brands 
was the opposite of the frst two sources. Specifcally, we found 
that, for both endorsement failures and successes, consumers at-
tributed signifcantly more responsibilities to virtual infuencers if 
the endorsement was caused by infuencers than by brands. Simi-
larly, more responsibilities were attributed to virtual infuencers’ 
companies when virtual infuencers rather than brands caused the 
endorsement. In contrast, consumers attributed more responsibil-
ity to endorsed brands if the endorsement was caused by brands 
than by virtual infuencers. One way to explain consumers’ dif-
ferent attribution patterns toward the multiple sources in virtual 
infuencer endorsements is that according to the source orienta-
tion model, people’s orientation toward a technology as a source 
of interaction afects how they evaluate messages from that tech-
nology [14., 24., 62.]. We suggest that having virtual agents as an 
immediate source requires fewer resources for interactions than 
distant sources, and thus it is easier to interact with and to maintain 
engagement. In contrast, interactions with more distant sources 
(e.g., programmers, organizations) are less engaged. The virtual 
agent and virtual infuencers’ company seem to be the locus of 
consumers’ interactions. According to Sundar and Nass [ 62.], this 
may imply the relatively greater visibility of the virtual agent and 
its creator as the locus of human–machine communication. This 
fnding is in line with Koh and Sundar’s [24.] study in which, for 
multiple layers of online communication (web agent, website, com-
puter), the primacy of web agent and web site over computer were 
identifed, suggesting that agent could be considered as the central 
target of social-psychological attributions made by users. 
Managerially, in this study, we investigated who consumers be-
lieve should take responsibility for virtual infuencers’ endorsement 
failures caused by either infuencer or brand misbehavior and en-
dorsement successes due to either infuencers’ or brand’s eforts, 
and we compared these attributions with human infuencer cases. 
In this way, we add to the conversation regarding whether virtual 
infuencers can serve alternatives to human endorsers in brand 
endorsements. First, our fndings indicate that virtual infuencers 
were attributed less blame for endorsement failures caused by an 
infuencer’s misbehavior than human infuencers. However, vir-
tual infuencers’ companies and endorsed brands were attributed 
signifcantly more responsibilities than their human counterparts. 
This fnding indicates that consumers consider the virtual infu-
encers’ company and endorsed brands to be responsible for virtual 
infuencers’ behavior and the resulting consequences in the brand 
endorsement. In this sense, brands should be cautious when em-
ploying virtual infuencers as endorsers because they are perceived 
190Unveiling Behind-the-Scenes Human Interventions and Examining Source Orientation in Virtual Influencer Endorsements IMX ’22, June 22–24, 2022, Aveiro, JB, Portugal 
to share the responsibility with infuencer companies for negative 
infuences resulting from virtual infuencers’ transgressions. 
Furthermore, research about human endorsers has established 
that brand–endorser relations are a two-way street, as such brands 
and advertisers must be aware of the impact endorser transgres-
sions have on consumer’s attitudes toward brands, as well as the 
impact brand transgressions have on consumers’ attitudes toward 
the endorser [57., 16.]. In this study, we thus expanded this line of 
research by examining whether this reciprocal infuence still holds 
for brands and virtual endorsers. We frst found that, generally, 
virtual infuencers were perceived as less attractive, less expert, 
and less trustworthy than human infuencers. Specifcally, virtual 
infuencers were perceived as having less expertise and less trust-
worthiness than human infuencers in endorsements initiated by 
brands, regardless of endorsement outcomes. Then, in endorsement 
failures caused either by infuencers’ misbehavior or brands’ mis-
behavior, consumers indicated similar attitudes regarding brands 
endorsed by virtual and human infuencers. Similarly, consumers 
indicated similar attitudes toward brands endorsed by virtual and 
human infuencers for endorsement success achieved by infuencers’ 
eforts. Only when an endorsement succeeded due to the brand’s 
eforts would consumers perceive brands endorsed by human in-
fuencers as signifcantly more favorable than brands endorsed by 
virtual infuencers. Therefore, we claim that endorser–brand re-
lations become much more complex when endorsers are virtual 
infuencers. It is no longer straightforward and clear for brands and 
advertisers to anticipate in which direction virtual endorsers and 
brands’ behaviors will infuence consumers’ attitudes toward each 
other. 
5.1 Limitations and Directions for Future 
Research 
This study is not without limitations. First, as a preliminary study, it 
has used real virtual infuencers and actual brand names (i.e., Sam-
sung, Magnum, Fenty beauty) to give participants a sense of realism. 
However, using real virtual infuencers and brand names may cause 
participants’ biases in processing endorsement messages. There-
fore, to control for extraneous variations in the data, future studies 
could include covariates such as virtual infuencer familiarity, brand 
familiarity, and brand knowledge. Further studies are also needed to 
examine whether these results still hold for fctitious virtual infu-
encers and brands, in which participants’ preexisting biases toward 
virtual infuencers and brands are excluded. Second, although this 
study examined perceptions toward virtual infuencers, who are 
mainly active on Instagram, many other variables are relevant to 
Instagram usage that may confound the results. Moreover, partici-
pants’ perspectives toward virtual infuencers may also serve as a 
factor that can impact their attribution toward virtual infuencers. 
Future research should try to address these limitations. 
In the future, it would be valuable for research to address other 
factors such as brand commitment and the association between 
virtual infuencers and the endorsed brand that afects endorsement 
efectiveness. Research has demonstrated that consumers’ brand 
commitments can moderate the efectiveness of endorsements be-
cause consumers with a higher level of brand commitment are 
likely to perceive endorsement messages diferently than those with lower levels of brand commitment [57.]. It would be interest-
ing to investigate how consumers’ brand commitments afect the 
ways in which they process endorsement messages from virtual 
infuencers. 
Further research could also explore how far the negative im-
pact caused by a virtual infuencer versus a brand’s misbehavior 
can reach. Research has suggested that virtual infuencers’ trans-
gressions can degrade consumers’ brand attitudes [10.]. Future re-
search should consider the potential impact of a virtual endorser’s 
misbehavior on consumers’ technology afnity and consumers’ 
perceptions of AI-produced advertising compared to human-made 
advertising.
