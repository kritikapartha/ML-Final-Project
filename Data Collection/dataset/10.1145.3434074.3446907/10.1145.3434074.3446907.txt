ABSTRACT 
Although every human should enjoy physical touch, intimacy, 
and sexual pleasure, persons with disabilities are often not in the 
position to fully experience the joys of life in the same manner 
as abled people. The United Nations stated in 1993 that persons 
with disabilities should enjoy family life and personal integrity 
and should not be denied the opportunity to experience their 
sexuality, have sexual relationships, and experience parenthood. 
However, after nearly 30 years of discussion, universal access to 
sexual and reproductive health remains an unfinished agenda for 
the disabled, as if society failed in recognizing people with 
disabilities as sexual beings. In this respect, a growing body of 
scholars have started to explore the idea of using technology to 
help disabled people satisfy some of these needs, although not 
without controversy. In concrete, ideas surrounding the use of 
robots for sex care purposes have been put forward, as service 
robots performing actions contributing directly towards 
improvement in the satisfaction of a user’s sexual needs. This 
paper continues to explore the potential use of these robots in 
disability care for sex care purposes, including for those with 
physical and mental health disabilities, which is currently 
underexplored. Our contribution seeks to understand whether 
sex robots could serve as a step forward in realizing the sexual 
rights of persons with disabilities. By building on a conceptual 
analysis of how sex robots could empower persons with 
disabilities to exercise their sexual rights, we hope to inform the 
policy debate around robots’ regulation and governance and set 
the scene for further research.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The creation and deployment of sex robots are accelerating. Sex 
robots are service robots that perform actions contributing 
directly towards improvement in the satisfaction of the sexual 
needs of a user [26]. Typically, sex robots have different 
embodiments, including fully or partially-bodied humanoids; 
body parts such as arms, heads, or genitals used for sex-related 
tasks; or non-biomimetic robotic devices used for sexual 
pleasure. These robots usually display realistic sex-related body 
movements, have sensors to react in real-time to user 
interaction, and include human cues such as voice, gaze, and lip-
sync to support human-like human-robot interactions. Other 
‘artificial agents capable of erotically engaging with humans’ or 
erobots are virtual or augmented reality partners and erotic 
chatbots [19]. However, this article frames this study exploring a 
particular intervention in sex care, that of sex robots. 
A growing body of literature reflects on other uses of sex 
robots than satisfying sexual pleasures. These robots may help 
address first-time sex-related anxiety, treat sexual dysfunctions, 
or promote safer sex in educational settings. Sex robots could 
create a safe, non-judgmental environment for people who feel 
insecure about their sexual orientation [45, 74]. Other more 
controversial applications are treatments for pedophiles and 
potential sex offenders [10].  
This paper continues to explore new uses for sex robots. We 
explore the potential use of sex robots for disability care 
purposes, including the physical and mentally ill, which is 
currently underexplored. The raison d'être of this article is 
simple: although every human should enjoy physical touch, 
intimacy, and sexual pleasure, persons with disabilities are often 
not in the position to fully experience the joys of life in the same 
manner as abled people. Moreover, although there have been

https://doi.org/10.1145/3434074.3446907international efforts towards realizing their sexual rights from 
institutions like the United Nations [94, 95], after nearly 30 years 
of discussion, this remains an unfinished agenda for the disabled 
[91]. This article argues that while contemporary societies 
succeeded in accepting (at the time) highly controversial social 
phenomena like same-sex marriage and transgender people, they 
failed to recognize people with disabilities as sexual beings [48, 
73]. 
Scheutz and Arnold [76] argue that ‘using sex robots have 
less to do with what a sex robot is, or how sex with a robot is 
categorized, than they do with different takes on the conditions 
and purposes of both personal relationships and society’s 
interests.’ This article takes a step forward in this direction by 
proposing the use of sex robots in care to empower persons with 
disabilities to exercise their sexual rights, which society too 
often disregards [103]. 
In this article, we investigate first to what extent the concept 
of care may or may not include sex as a fundamental aspect. 
Second, we review existing robots for sex care purposes. In the 
third section, we explore the potential realization of sex robots 
for care purposes. We also anticipate drawbacks concerning the 
use and implementation of such types of robots in healthcare. 
Our contribution does not endeavor in making decisive 
judgments for or against the use of sex robots in the care of 
persons with disabilities. With utmost respect to the potential 
target users, we aim to create a room for discussion with the 
Human-Robot Interaction community about converging and 
diverging opinions on the topic of robots for sex care. Hopefully, 
these discussions will serve as a step forward in raising 
awareness of the lack of attention concerning the sexual rights 
of the disabled and provide the basis for envisaging solutions in 
this arena, including informing the policy debate around the 
regulation of robots and setting the scene for further research. 
2 PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR 
SEXUAL RIGHTS 
The World Health Organization defines sexual health as the 
‘state of physical, mental, and social well-being concerning 
sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to 
sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of 
having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, 
discrimination, and violence’ [104]. 
Although sexuality is a central aspect of human experience, 
awareness, and knowledge do not come straightforward for 
disabled populations. On the contrary, evidence suggests that 
this is largely constrained, pathologized, and ignored in mental 
health settings [96], whereas if society truly supported human 
dignity, it should take the claims of those who lose the ability to 
be sexual sincerely and make reasonable efforts to help in this 
respect [35].  
Many aspects constrain how people with disabilities 
experience and engage with themselves as sexual beings, 
including their particular disability and sociocultural, religion, 
economics, age, and gender factors [2, 35]. Still, some of the most worrisome barriers come from the very same institutions. Some 
researchers highlight that people with intellectual disabilities are 
‘purposefully misinformed about sexual health to reinforce fears 
as a means of inhibiting sexual activity’ [78]. Others that 
healthcare providers consider that ‘people with intellectual 
disabilities or other disabilities should not have a sexual life, 
reproduce or look after children, and therefore should not need 
sexual and reproductive health services’ [103]. Other 
quantitative studies show that non-disabled people perceive 
people with physical disabilities as having fewer sexual and 
reproductive rights [29], sometimes even asexual [78], especially 
women [100]. 
If a person is physically disabled, physical disability may 
prevent that person from satisfying her sexual needs. For 
instance, think of a person who is deprived of her upper-limbs or 
is paralyzed [73]. On the other side, people experiencing mental 
illness may experience sexuality and intimate relationships very 
differently for several reasons [96]. Some of them relate to their 
mental health condition that often leads them to poor sexual 
outcomes, including high rates of sexually transmitted infections 
and blood-borne disease, unplanned pregnancy, and sexual 
assault [33]. Others are structural and social factors associated 
with mental illness, including stigma [51, 64]. The medication 
they take also decreases their sexual desire levels or physical, 
almost leading to sexual dysfunction [68]. 
It could be that organizations are confused about the legality 
of offering support to a safe sexual expression [4]. However, 
since 1993, the United Nations has stressed that persons with 
disabilities should enjoy family life and personal integrity, and 
should ‘not be denied the opportunity to experience their 
sexuality, have sexual relationships and experience parenthood’ 
(Rule 9, para. 2) [94]. The Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities [95] also highlights that people with disabilities 
should have the right to enjoy the highest standard of health 
without discrimination based on disability. It also mentioned 
that States should ‘provide persons with disabilities with the 
same range, quality, and standard of free or affordable health 
care and programs as provided to other persons, including in the 
area of sexual and reproductive health and population-based 
public health programs.’ 
Studies report that attitudes towards sexuality in the general 
population are more favorable than those with some disability 
[52, 103]. However, age and occupation play a significant role: 
while staff education and attitudes towards sex rights of persons 
with disabilities are not related, younger (20-29) and managers 
are usually more optimistic than older, direct workers 
concerning sex in institutional care [52].  
It seems that the full realization of the sexual rights of 
persons with disabilities requires more research and policies that 
understand the intersection of people, disability, and sexual 
rights [2]. In Jecker’s words, ‘just as society has the power to 
insult people’s dignity by shaming and stigmatizing their sexual 
desires and behavior, it has the power to support dignity and 
serve as a bulwark against shame’ [35]. These policies could 
represent a step forward in treating people with disabilities in a 
alt.HRI
 
HRI ’21 Companion, March 8–11, 2021, Boulder, CO, USA
2dignity-respecting and non-discriminatory fashion concerning 
their sexual rights [26].  
Some countries have reflected on how the general and 
abstract idea of the sexual rights of people with disabilities can 
be translated into concrete actions. In the Netherlands, for 
instance, they materialize it into what has been called sex care. 
Although this concept lacks a precise definition, Nwanazia [61] 
defines sex care as a ‘sexual service for people with severe 
physical or mental disabilities (...) often done by professionals 
with a background in health care (...) focused on intimacy, 
physical touch and sexual satisfaction for disabled clients.’ In 
Europe, there is a platform called the European Platform Sexual 
Assistance for Persons with Disabilities (EPSEAS) that brings 
together different non-profit organizations offering sexual 
services for people with disabilities.  
However, while sex care is good progress in materializing the 
abstract idea of supporting a person’s sexual needs, it raises 
many questions. First, it is not clear the necessary knowledge 
required for satisfying the sexual needs of a disabled person and 
whether there should be minimum safeguards. Second, sex work 
is controversial concerning sex workers’ legal status and the lack 
of institutionalized structure. Sex work has traditionally involved 
many related crimes. They are illegal in many jurisdictions, and 
they oftentimes mask crimes that range from violence against 
prostitutes to human trafficking. In this respect, it is highly 
controversial to think that publicly available funds should cover 
these services. For these reasons, sex care has been far from 
successful. There are very few (if none) studies considering the 
viability of sex care for disabled persons, suggesting a highly 
relevant area for further research. 
3 SEX ROBOTS 
3.1 Sex Robot Characteristics 
Previous work adapted the ISO 8373-2012 definition of a robot to 
define sex robots as service robots that perform actions 
contributing directly towards improvement in the satisfaction of 
the sexual needs of a user [26]. Following that definition, which 
requires a robot to be programmable and incorporate a degree of 
freedom, all other electronic sex devices are excluded here. Sex 
robots incorporate a range of technologies that distinguishes 
them from mere silicone sex dolls that emit computeresque voice 
from a perpetually agape mouth, with restricted limb movements 
and no physical feedback. Sex robots can display realistic sex-
related body movements, have sensors to react in real-time to 
user interaction. 
A recent review [26] identified 12 robots that meet the 
definition mentioned above of a sex robot. While those 12 sex 
robots were in varying states (i.e., either purchasable, in 
development, or not for sale), they were actualized fully or in 
part. The 12 sex robots identified were TrueCompanion’s Roxxxy 
and Rocky, Emma, and other models from Shenzhen All 
Intelligent Robot Technology (AI-Tech), Android Love Dolls’ 
Robot Sex Dolls, Realdollx models, Fantasy AI Silicone Love Doll, 
Synthea Amatus’ AI Dolls (including Samantha), ExDoll’s Xiaodie, DS Doll Robotics’ first and second-generation Robot 
Doll Heads, Gabriel2052, and Android Robot Store’s Android 
Robot Dolls [26]. The review also developed a list of categories 
(and subcategories) that capture the different characteristics of 
sex robots. Those categories were: Gender/body type, 
Embodiment, Mobility and battery, Smart connectivity, 
Autonomous sexual awareness, Autonomous sexual 
responsiveness, Non-autonomous actionability, Sociability, 
Learning, Human-likeness (or human mimicry), and Hygiene 
[26]. 
Since that review was conducted throughout Mid-2019, no 
new sex robots have entered the market. However, there have 
been a few notable developments. Cloud Climax, the UK agent 
for AI-Tech, has upgraded Emma to include moving eyes (i.e., 
movement of eyeballs) [3]. More than blinking and eyebrow 
movements, moving eyes gives the impression that a sex robot is 
looking around. They also intend to equip Emma with the 
capacity to breathe, which presumably involves an expanding 
and collapsing chest cavity [54]. However, this has yet to be 
implemented. Abyss Creations have added two new models to 
the Realdollx lineup, Serenity and Nova. Moving eyes have also 
been newly integrated into the Realdollx lineup [1]. Abyss 
Creations [1] claim that ‘[b]uilt-in cameras are in development,’ 
but no further details are given. 
3.2 Human-Robot Interaction and Sex Robots 
The topic of sex robots yields mixed reactions in the Human-
Robot Interaction (HRI) community, raising both concerns and 
potential benefits. Some concerns include deception and 
encouraging users to attribute thoughts, emotions, and bonds to 
robots wrongly [43, 58, 75, 82], desensitization and 
reinforcement of poor sexual behaviors [12, 47, 82], and the 
objectification of women [70, 82]. Several potential benefits 
include alternatives to prostitutes in the provision of sex care 
[44], avoiding challenging the sexual rights of others [16], and 
curbing sex exploitation, sex trafficking, and sex slavery as a 
result of the reduction of human prostitution [74]. 
Much of the impacts of sex robot use remain unknown. In a 
2020 review of sex doll and sex robot design, use, and effects, 
Döring, Mohseni, & Walter [18] found no published empirical 
studies that address sex robot use reported by sex robot users. 
Until empirical research on sex robot use is completed, the 
benefits and consequences to users remain unconfirmed.  
The role of sex roboticists and sex robot designers is 
complicated [14, 15, 38]. One encounters problematic design 
considerations in the design process, such as robot rape [14] and 
the usual focus on straight male needs [77]. The HRI literature 
on the design of sex robots offers some guidance for roboticists 
working in this area, but more is needed going forward. In 
response to the concern about sex robots objectifying women, 
Danaher [13] suggests pursuing feminist sex robots . Drawing 
insights from feminist pornography, designing sex robots with a 
feminist approach encourages realistic and fair depictions of 
sexuality, more female voices in production and distribution, and 
inclusive social environments and conversations on the use of 
sex robots [13]. A recent study [87] reporting on sex doll use 
alt.HRI
 
HRI ’21 Companion, March 8–11, 2021, Boulder, CO, USA
3uses empirical findings to glean design considerations for sex 
robots. Some insights include considering the intimate fantasies 
that users construct with sex dolls and how that experience is 
supported or contradicted with the customization of sex robots, 
and being aware that users could develop intimate attachment 
for these artifacts that they perceive to require care and how this 
calls for a design that accounts for long-term use [87].  
Other HRI publications present additional sex robot design 
considerations on speech [8], kissing [9], embodiment [21, 32, 
98], consent [40], and accounting for ethical concerns emerging 
from anthropomorphization, including possible user emotional 
vulnerability, deception, and prevention from engaging in 
relationships with humans [62]. Some of the HRI literature also 
makes recommendations on the sex robot design process, such 
as calling for the involvement of scientists engaged in sexual 
research [21] and applying existing knowledge during the design 
phase about the philosophy of love, the ethics of loving 
relationships, and the value of the erotic [88]. 
3.3 Growing Acceptance of Sex Robots 
Scheutz and Arnold [76] conducted a methodical survey of the 
public opinion towards robots and sex. They concluded that, 
overall, participants considered ‘more or less strongly as 
appropriate’ different uses of sex robots, including their use for 
disabled people, sex education, to improve self-esteem and 
overall psychological health, or to improve hormone levels of 
people with infrequent sex lives.  
Although there have been no new sex robots entering the 
market, as well as only a few publicly confirmed advances in the 
technology, acceptance of sex robots has risen. According to a 
study conducted by YouGov in 2020, ‘more than one in five 
Americans (22%) say they would consider having sex with a 
robot,’ which is 6% more than the national rate in 2017 [59]. 
Other trends related to sex robot use are experiencing 
interesting shifts towards acceptability also. For instance, to the 
question ‘ Would you consider cheating if you had a partner who 
had sex with a robot, ’ there was a decrease from 32% to 27% of 
interviewed Americans that answered ‘yes’ to the answer, 
‘probably because engaging in sex with a robot as closer to 
masturbation (31%) than actual intercourse (14%)’ [59]. 
Moreover, 42% of the respondents believed that having sexual 
intercourse with robots is safer than with other human strangers 
(only 7% thought it would be less secure). 
In other recent publications, sex robots have not been put in 
the best light. A satirical article written as if it was the journal of 
a sex robot worker concludes: ‘I figured it was a good time to 
stop for the day and recharge. I think I’ve learned what men 
want. They just want to be intimate, feel validated, and get off 
with a lubricated servo that’s capable of one thousand pulsations 
a second’ [55]. From the simple over-exaggeration of battery 
capacity to the gross fetishization and stereotyping of all users as 
(1) men and (2) those seeking ‘one thousand pulsations a 
second,’ such media about sex robots spreads misinformation. 
This kind of discourse disregards the potential use of sex robots 
as aids in sex care, which could improve the well-being of people with disabilities and advance their care towards equity. 
However, more research is needed to support this. 
4 SEX ROBOT APPLICATIONS FOR SEX CARE 
Progress in medicine may serve to revisit social norms that 
currently represent a barrier to sexuality in specific populations 
[46]. Advances in the sex robot industry may also shape how sex 
is conceived for the care sector. Bendel [7], for instance, already 
classified healthcare robots as surgical, therapeutic, nursing, and 
sex robots, arguing that ‘a sex life that fulfills the individual 
needs surely contributes to health and well-being.’  
Sex robots are not mere inanimate masturbation aid. They 
also include features that ascribe sociability and human-likeness 
to robot-mediated sexual relationships. In this sense, Döring et 
al. [18] argue that sex robots ‘are meaningful and possibly 
helpful precisely because they are not substitutes for real 
humans but are sociotechnical entities for parasocial use and 
play.’ Others have argued otherwise, holding that a sex robot 
only facilitates masturbation, not sexual intercourse, which 
requires another human [83]. 
Sex robots have many sexual characteristics and capabilities 
that might prove useful in fulfilling the sexual desires of those in 
disability care. Using thematic analysis [56], three key themes 
that capture those uses were identified: sexual, emotional, and 
educational. Discussing these themes with the HRI community 
will indeed point to more research to understand how robot 
technology might help specific populations and under which 
circumstances this could be considered a positive or a harmful 
aid. 
4.1 Sexual Theme 
Recent literature proves no loss of libido in the disabled adult 
population [41, 92]. People with intellectual disabilities have 
sexual needs and engage in sex and long-term relationships [20]. 
However, barriers to sexual expression for this group exist in 
care services, including institutionalized living, lack of privacy, 
and lack of knowledge about sexuality and opportunities to 
express themselves [11]. For those with physical disabilities, 
while sexual esteem, satisfaction, and frequency seem to trend 
lower as the severity of physical disability increases [50], sexual 
needs are still salient [39]. 
As a tool, sex robots could help provide a safe environment 
for persons with disabilities to explore sexuality. Some sex 
robots, such as Rocky or Roxxxy, can perform simple sexual 
movements, i.e., moving back and forth from the user rather 
than requiring them to move. This function could be useful for 
those with physical disabilities as it affords the user the ability to 
use a sex robot without high physical cost. Furthermore, sex 
robots that enable masturbation, such a Gabriel2052 with a 
robotic arm or a Realdollx model with a massaging function, 
could cater to a physically disabled user’s need. 
Still in the sexual theme, but on the tamer side of 
companionship, is intimacy. The literature shows that disabled 
persons seek intimacy [49, 81]. For men with physical 
alt.HRI
 
HRI ’21 Companion, March 8–11, 2021, Boulder, CO, USA
4disabilities, nude cuddling is a significant predictor of sexual 
satisfaction [50]. This kind of intimacy could be realized with sex 
robots, much like sex dolls [87]. For example, Emma has internal 
heating systems that make the sex robot warm to the touch, 
intentionally simulating a person. Similarly, deep kissing is 
important for sexual satisfaction in women with physical 
disabilities [50]. Sex robots, such as the Realldollx models, have 
dynamic mouth movements that could imitate kissing. 
Exoskeletons for sex purposes enable a sex robot to walk and 
move its arms, such as those by the Android Robot Store. As 
another type of physical intimacy, walking and limb articulation 
functions could enable a sex robot and user to walk together and 
hold hands. 
4.2 Emotional Theme 
While sex robots have a clear functional goal to satisfy users’ 
sexual needs, manufacturers profoundly stress their technology’s 
emotional support side. For example, Emma uses voice 
recognition to acknowledge the user as an individual. Roxxxy 
and Realdollx models have personalities that the user can select 
from to best suit their needs. In the case of Realdollx models, the 
personality adapts to the user over time, using deep learning 
conversational models. Samantha and other sex robots from 
Synthea Amatus are equipped with human-like cues, such as 
likes and dislikes, laughter, and moods. They can make faces, 
smile, frown, and look attentive.  
Sexual acts manifest different physical feelings, such as 
bodily pleasure and enjoyment, but they are also closely linked 
with emotions. These emotional features seem to advance the 
idea that sex robots could support positive, close encounters 
with persons beyond purely sexual experiences. People with 
severe physical and mental health disabilities that lack social 
skills require patience from those who socially interact with 
them [34, 53]. Disabled persons might find a robot’s intrinsic 
patience valuable, as they could converse with a sex robot as 
much as they need/want to without the robot losing patience.  
Robots for sex care could represent the uniting of emotional 
support and sexual companionship that benefit users in disability 
care [35]. Consider the persistent issue of LGBTQ+ disabled 
persons lacking the adequate support and service provision to 
explore sexuality, experience relationships, and be out and proud  
[60, 102]. Rocky, an android sex robot, could help a closeted gay 
man who never pursued gay relationships or sexual relations. 
Some closeted, disabled gay men may be afraid to express their 
gay orientation with others in care settings for fear of judgment, 
denial, anxiety, or inexperience. In this instance, introducing 
Rocky in this specific context could allow that person to grow 
sexually and emotionally without fear. 
A sex robot might be a non-judgmental solution for sexual 
exploration among users, including disabled persons. Users could 
utilize gendered sex robots to explore their sexuality if they 
never had the chance previously [45]. Realdollx models can be 
fitted with a ‘transgender converter,’ enabling the possibility for 
sexual exploration with sex robots to go beyond the gender 
binary. 
 4.3 Educational Theme 
Murphy & O’Callaghan [57] conducted a study asking adults 
with intellectual disabilities and young persons to assess their 
sexual knowledge on vulnerability to abuse. The study revealed 
that participants with intellectual disabilities scored low 
concerning their understanding of consent and abuse, suggesting 
a profound need to have more and better sex education for 
persons with intellectual disabilities to exercise their sexual 
rights while also protecting themselves [57].  
Sex robots could help disabled persons with cognitive 
challenges learn about sexuality and emotions, including 
consent. This is important because abusive sexual behavior in 
disabled populations is unsettlingly common [31, 78]. Sex robots 
might serve an educational purpose by providing on-going, 
practical sex education for these persons. For instance, the robot 
Samantha can detect aggressive touching from a user using 
sensors across the body and turn itself off without giving sexual 
feedback. In this respect, cognitively challenged people may lack 
the awareness or understanding to determine if a potential 
sexual partner is giving consent or not. The robot Samantha 
could teach those individuals the consent process by having to 
be gently touched by the user to activate. 
5 SOCIETAL AND DESIGN IMPLICATIONS 
5.1 Sex Robot in Care Implications 
It is also essential to notice that, paradoxically, technology 
increasingly has a habit of being both the source of and the 
solution to societal problems, and robots are no exception [6, 24]. 
There are countless examples of how technology has been 
proposed to solve inadequate engineering practice, government 
policy failures, or modern consumerism outcomes, showing how 
technological fixes have cultural, ethical, and political 
implications [6, 37]. Sex robots may offer a good solution to 
support human dignity for disabled populations, but these robots 
may also bring other unexpected consequences. 
In this sense, sex robots in care are still under exploration 
[23, 26]. Even the use of care robots still faces challenges [36, 63]. 
Thus, the literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of the 
impacts that sex robots in care may have on disabled 
populations. Table 1 collates recent studies reflecting upon care 
robot implications that anticipate some of these impacts [23, 79, 
93, 97, 99]. After that, Table 2 reflects on the added implications 
of sex robots found in the literature [12, 16, 17, 22, 25, 35, 43, 44, 
47, 69-72, 74-76, 80, 82-84, 88-90, 101]:

adoption and continuous use. 
5.2 Anticipation, Reflection, and Action 
These reflections anticipate that the design and implementation 
of sex robots in care is not straightforward and requires careful 
thought. In Johnston’s words [37], ‘modern problems cannot be 
reduced to mere engineering solutions over the long-term; 
human goals are diverse and constantly changing.’ A great start 
would be to follow initiatives promoting reflection upon the 
consequences and outcomes of technological research and 
development (R&D) that foster the incorporation of societally-
oriented considerations into the research or the design process 
[85]. These exercises would entail researchers and designers 
working in this area to [5, 42, 86]: (1) anticipate potential adverse 
consequences of their work to build socially robust and risk-free 
research; (2) reflect mindfully about their work, framing issues, 
problems, and proposed solutions; (3) be inclusive and conduct 
research not only for society but also with society, thus involving 
a wide range of stakeholders from the early stages of the 
process; (4) respond to circumstances that no longer align with 
society’s continually evolving needs and public values; and (5) be transparent about the research to enable public scrutiny and 
dialogue. 
Table 2: Summaries of the main implications of sex robot 
use and development for care purposes 
Sex care-related 
consideration Explanation Dehumanizing care Care robots might dehumanize care 
practices. The dehumanizing effects 
of sex robots are unclear. 
Reinforcing 
existing biases Sex robots reflect sexist, racist, ableist, 
ageist, and heterosexist attitudes. 
Challenging 
dignity A sex robot in care might challenge 
the dignity of specific populations. Prostitution and 
rape Robots may allow for the 
reproduction of morally questionable 
behaviors that may replicate in 
society. Distorting 
relationships 
further Users of sex robots, including those 
for sex care, may believe that there is 
a close bidirectional relationship 
when, in reality, those bonds are 
unidirectional. 
Techno- 
solutionism and 
the never-ending 
problem solving Robots may offer opportunities but 
create other problems, like 
desensitization towards sexual 
behavior, justification or 
reinforcement of one’s poor actions 
through the distortion of one’s 
cognition from frequent sex robot use, 
the objectification of women, and 
reinforcement of existing sexism or 
machismo in society.  
In doing so, robot developers will realize the need to follow 
other methods to help see what these public values are, what 
purpose these robots serve to society, and how existing 
relationships will change. In this particular context involving 
disabled populations, it will be essential to anticipate the specific 
physical and sex-related needs that disabled persons might have. 
Methods that cater to the creation of robots to the particular 
needs of users include value-sensitive design [27], care-centered 
value-sensitive design [99], and values in motion design [65-67]. 
In this respect, the engagement between sex robot makers, care 
providers, and persons with disabilities may help configure a 
more-than-human-centered approach to sex robots in care [30]. 
Following these approaches would allow for new avenues in 
how society conceives robots. For instance, given current 
attitudes and narratives concerning sexuality, it is of little 
astonishment that sex robots are usually not targeted to people 
with disabilities but young, non-disabled, and typically straight 
men [35]. In this respect, the HRI community could help 
generate counternarratives about potential sexual futures that 
include older adults, persons with disabilities, different sexual

6orientations, and sex robots to counteract the technological 
determinism ruling our contemporary narratives [30]. 
6 CONCLUSION 
This paper discussed whether sex robots could serve as a step 
forward in realizing the sexual rights of persons with disabilities. 
Whether social, psychological, or biological, several difficulties 
may negatively impact an individual’s well-being, their 
experience of mental health services, and their recovery. Some of 
those impediments in physically and mentally disabled 
populations prevent them from experiencing the pleasures of 
life, including having sexual relationships and realizing their 
sexual rights. Other barriers often relate to the stigmatization of 
older adults and disabled population needs, which are often 
unfounded. Technology offers the possibility to truly empower 
disabled people and end the remaining silences about sexuality 
for this part of the population [2, 35]. In this respect, society 
should take reasonable steps to support human capabilities as 
part of a more all-inclusive duty to respect human dignity [35]. 
Still, while sex robots may support human dignity for 
disabled populations, these robots may also bring other 
unexpected consequences. Robot technology may have moral 
implications, contribute to the loss of human contact, reinforce 
existing socioeconomic inequalities, or fail to deliver good care 
[26]. There is no proof that sex robot technology is going to be 
any different. Moreover, these technologies might have long-
term catastrophic or existential risks and might have to ‘be 
subject to planning and mitigation efforts commensurate with 
their expected impact’ [28].  
If responsible, innovation may contribute to ensuring a 
desirable future for humanity. In this paper, we call for the HRI 
community to mindfully think about the potential sex robots 
may have in care. However, we alert them that this area of 
research is very sensitive and may have ulterior implications not 
only for particular subjects but also for society. In this vein, 
researchers in HRI need to reflect, together with other 
disciplines, end-users, and policymakers, how this research can 
meaningfully contribute to society [5].
