ABSTRACT
The hybrid attack was proposed by Howgrave-Graham in CRYPTO2007,
which was originally designed for the cryptanalysis of NTRU cryp-
tosystems. In this paper, based on Howgrave-Graham’s attack model,
we propose a simulator of hybrid attack to evaluate the hardness of
the unique shortest vector problem. By a dynamical computation,
our algorithm can trade off the cost between reduction and MitM,
while both of them run in exponential time. Further, we adapt our
simulator to Giophantus.., Giophantus+and Giophantus−cryp-
tosystems, proposed by Akiyama et al. in SAC2017, SCIS2019 and
SCIS2020, respectively. Our analysis shows that by the hybrid attack,
the security levels can be reduced by at most 19 bits for Giophantus’
parameters proposed in NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
standardization 1st round submission. Meanwhile, the parameter
sets of Giophantus+and Giophantus−are secure against the hybrid
attack.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3384940.3388958topic in the crypto world. NIST takes the lead of standardization
for PQC in 2017, and many proposals are under evaluation [ 1].
Thereinto, the lattice-based cryptoschemes are considered to be the
most compelling candidates due to their elegant designs and flex-
ible parameter settings. Most of the mathematical hard problems
underlying these lattice-based cryptoschemes are the well-known
learning with errors (LWE) problem, the ring learning with er-
rors (RLWE) and their variants [ 17,18]. Practical and theoretical
cryptanalysis are required for evaluating the parameter sets there.
Howgrave-Graham [ 14] proposed the hybrid attack to re-estimate
the security of NTRU cryptoscheme in 2007. It hybridizes a lat-
tice reduction algorithm and the Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack
and outperforms either of the two attacks separately. Therefore,
a number of lattice-based cryptoschemes use the hybrid attack
when evaluating their parameters. Since then, the hybrid attack is
considered to be one of the most efficient attacks to lattice-based
cryptoschemes. However, since there are many parameters in the
hybrid attack and it is not easy to evaluate an optimal setting for
the hybrid attack, most of the cryptoschemes such as the NIST PQC
proposals [ 1] just mention the existence of this attack by a couple of
words or only give a rough estimation lacking any lucid simulator
(or say, an estimator).
In this work, we study the hybrid attack and propose its simu-
lator to evaluate the hardness of the unique shortest vector prob-
lem which generally can be reduced from the LWE problem, the
RLWE problem, NTRU, etc. Our simulator is based on the geometric
series assumption [ 19], the property of unchangeable lattice vol-
ume, and the so-called 2016 estimate [ 6]. As an example, we apply
our simulator to the lattice-based cryptoscheme Giophantus [ 3]
and its variants. The Giophantus schemes proposed to the first
round of NIST PQC standardization project, and the later versions
Giophantus+, Giophantus−are NTRU-like post-quantum cryptosys-
tems whose security depend on the problem of solving the indeter-
minate equations. The schemes have the potential to combine the
high encryption/decryption speed of lattice-based schemes with
the nonlinearity of multivariate schemes; nevertheless, the NIST
proposed version Giophantus are depending on the problem of
solving linear indeterminate equations. In practice, these schemes
reduce the probability of decoding failure to zero. As a result, the
key recovery problem is equivalent to a unique shortest vector prob-
lem that can be applied to the hybrid lattice attack due to finding
small solutions compared with the large modulus 𝑞.

281.1 Related Works
In 2007, Howgrave-Graham [ 14] proposed the idea of a hybrid at-
tack and showed its threat to NTRU schemes. Some subsequent
works are trying to improve the hybrid attack applicable to the
learning with errors (LWE) variants, or extending the distribution
of target vector rather than binary, etc. A theoretical analysis of
the hybrid attack was given in [ 12]. Furthermore, an application
of the hybrid attack to binary LWE was analyzed in [ 8]. About the
success probability, theoretical analysis with additional assumption
is given in [ 12] and [ 8] but lack of experimental verification. In ad-
dition, Wunderer [ 22] pointed out the overestimate of lattice-based
cryptosystems derived from the flawed analysis due to roughly
simplifying the assumptions in the hybrid attack. In that work, he
proposed a generalized model of hybrid attack on the bounded
distance decoding (BDD) problem. He also applied the algorithm
in cryptanalysis using two formulas of over- and underestimation
of the hybrid attack’s complexity. Moreover, he gave a method to
construct lattice bases for trinary NTRU and various cases to be
used in the hybrid attack. A quantum version of the hybrid attack
was proposed in [ 11], where the MitM part is sped up by using a
generalization of Grover’s quantum search algorithm. However,
the hybrid attack seems not considered or just roughly referred
among most candidates of the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) standardization project. To give a concrete evaluation for the
proposals, we need a feasible hybrid attack simulator.
1.2 Our Contribution
In this work, based on the Howgrave-Graham’s attack model in [ 14],
we propose a hybrid attack simulator on the unique Shortest Vector
Problem (uSVP). By a dynamical computation in the simulator, we
take account of the trade-off between the cost of lattice reduction
part and the cost of MitM, since both of them are exponential-time
algorithms with respect to the corresponding dimensions. Further,
we adapt our simulator on Giophantus [ 3], Giophantus+[16] and
Giophantus−[4] cryptoschemes, which are proposed by Akiyama
et al. The security of Giophantus, Giophantus+and Giophantus−
can be reduced to the hardness of the unique shortest vector prob-
lem by the key recovery attack. Using our proposed simulator of
hybrid attack, it shows that the security levels are reduced by at
most 19 bits for Giophantus’ parameters proposed in NIST PQC
standardization 1st round submission. Meanwhile, the parameter
sets of Giophantus+and Giophantus−are secure against the hybrid
attack.
1.3 Roadmap
Section 2 covers notations and background. We recall the MitM
attack and the hybrid attack in Section 3. In Section 4 we propose
our simulator of the hybrid attack on uSVP. As an example, we
show the cryptanalysis results on Giophantus, Giophantus+and
Giophantus−. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 5.

2.1 Lattice
Alattice𝐿⊂R𝑚is generated by a set of linearly independent
vectors b1,..., b𝑛inR𝑚:𝐿(b1,..., b𝑛)={Í𝑛
𝑖=1𝑥𝑖b𝑖|𝑥𝑖∈Z}.
B=(b1,..., b𝑛)forms a basis of𝐿. The integers 𝑛and𝑚are called
therank and the dimension of𝐿respectively. It is called a full-
rank lattice if𝑛=𝑚. We denote by 𝜆𝑖(𝐿)the length of 𝑖-th linear
independent shortest vector for 𝑖=1,...,𝑛 in a non-trivial lattice
𝐿, e.g.𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 of𝐿is one of the 𝜆1(𝐿)-length vectors.
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) . We denote by B∗=
(b∗
1,..., b∗𝑛)the associated Gram-Schmidt orthogonal basis of the
given lattice basis B=(b1,..., b𝑛). The GSO components can be
computed by b∗
1=b1,b∗
𝑖=b𝑖−Í𝑖−1
𝑗=1𝜇𝑖𝑗b∗
𝑗for2≤𝑖≤𝑛where
𝜇𝑖𝑗=⟨b𝑖,b∗
𝑗⟩
∥b∗
𝑗∥2,1≤𝑗<𝑖≤𝑛. Define the orthogonal projection
𝜋𝑖:R𝑛→𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛(b1,..., b𝑖−1)⊥. Thus, we have 𝜋𝑖(b𝑘)=b𝑘−Í𝑖−1
𝑗=1𝜇𝑖𝑗b∗
𝑗,1≤𝑗<𝑖≤𝑘≤𝑛. Furthermore, denote by 𝜋𝑖(𝐿)a
lattice generated by the basis (𝜋𝑖(b𝑖),𝜋𝑖(b𝑖+1),...,𝜋𝑖(b𝑛)).
The fundamental domain of𝐿corresponding to Bis the set
F(b1,..., b𝑛)={𝑡1b1+𝑡2b2+···+𝑡𝑛b𝑛: 0≤𝑡𝑖<1}. The
volume (ordeterminant) of a lattice 𝐿is the volume ofF(B), which
is denoted by vol( 𝐿) (or det(𝐿)) and can be calculated by det(𝐿)=p
det(B⊤B)=Î𝑛
𝑖=1∥b∗
𝑖∥. Note that all the bases of 𝐿have the same
number𝑛of elements, and all their fundamental domains have the
same volume.
𝑞-ary Lattice. A lattice𝐿⊂Z𝑚is called a𝑞-ary lattice if 𝑞Z𝑚⊂𝐿
for an integer 𝑞. Let A∈Z𝑛×𝑚𝑞(𝑚≥𝑛)be a matrix, we define the
Session 2

29𝑚-dimensional 𝑞-ary lattice as
𝐿⊥
(A,𝑞)={x∈Z𝑚|Ax≡0(mod𝑞)}.
It is clearly generated by the kernel 𝐾𝑒𝑟(A)ofAmod𝑞with
vol(𝐿⊥
(A,𝑞))=𝑞𝑛.
Gaussian Heuristic . The Gaussian Heuristic can estimate the num-
ber of points in 𝑆∩𝐿approximately vol( 𝑆)/vol(𝐿), for a given lattice
𝐿and a continuous subset 𝑆⊂R𝑛.
In particular, if 𝑆is a origin-centred ball of radius 𝑅, the number
of joint lattice points is 𝑉𝑛(𝑅)/vol(𝐿). Thus the length 𝜆1of the
shortest vector can be estimated by:
𝜆1(𝐿)≈(Γ(𝑛/2+1)vol(𝐿))1/𝑛
√𝜋,
where the gamma function 𝛤(𝑠)is defined for 𝑠>0by the integral
𝛤(𝑠)=∫∞
0𝑡𝑠−1·𝑒−𝑡𝑑𝑡.
2.2 Lattice Problems
Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) . Given a lattice basis B, the short-
est vector problem (SVP) is to find one shortest non-zero vector of
𝐿(B).
Unique Shortest Vector Problem (uSVP) .Unique SVP problem is
for a given lattice 𝐿with promise of 𝜆1(𝐿)≪𝜆2(𝐿), find a shortest
vector in𝐿.
Closest Vector Problem (CVP) . Given a basis Bof a lattice𝐿and
a target vector t, the closest vector problem asks to find a closest
vector b∈𝐿(B), s.t.∥t−b∥≤∥ t−v∥for∀v∈𝐿(B). We denote it
by CVP(t,B) in this paper.
Bounded Distance Decoding (BDD) . The definition of BDD( t,B)
is analogous but looser than CVP( t,B): with an additional condition
that there is bounded distance of length 𝑑from tto𝐿(B), BDD asks
to find a lattice vector bs.t.∥t−b∥≤𝑑.
Learning With Errors (LWE) Problem [18] . Let𝐷𝜎denote a
bounded distribution with standard deviation 𝜎. Sample a matrix
A∈Z𝑚×𝑛𝑞(𝑚,𝑛∈Z)uniformly at random; and randomly sample
relatively small secret vector s∈𝐷𝑛𝜎ande∈𝐷𝑚𝜎. The pairs of
(A,b≡As+e(mod𝑞))∈Z𝑚×𝑛𝑞×Z𝑚𝑞are called as LWE samples.
TheLWE problem is for a given LWE sample (A,b), to compute the
pair(s,e).
Ring LWE (RLWE) Problem [17] . For ramdomly sampled poly-
nomials𝑎∈𝑅𝑞,𝑛,𝑠∈𝑅𝑞,𝑛, and𝑒where𝑒’s coeffients are sampled
from𝐷𝜎,(𝑎,𝑏=𝑎·𝑠+𝑒∈𝑅𝑞,𝑛)is called as a RLWE sample. The
RLWE problem is that given 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝑛)number of RLWE samples of
(𝑎,𝑏), to find𝑠(and𝑒simultaneously).
2.3 Lattice Algorithms
Typically the above-introduced lattice problems can be reduced to
the SVP or uSVP. Namely, in some sense, doing cryptanalysis on the
lattice-based cryptoschemes is equivalent to analyzing the hardness
of reduced SVP or uSVP. One of the best-known lattice algorithms
isBKZ algorithm [20], which processes the given basis until being
almost𝛽-reduced. In other words, the projected lengths of each
basis vectors are the shortest ones in the relative 𝛽-dimensional
sub-lattice. BKZ costs exponentially in the blocksize 𝛽.In 2001, Ajtai et al. proposed a sieving algorithm to solve SVP [ 2].
It requires a runtime of 20.52𝑛+𝑜(𝑛)in dimension 𝑛and requires
exponential storage of 20.2𝑛+𝑜(𝑛)as well. For a 𝛽-dimensional sub-
lattice the cost of sieving algorithm can be estimated in 20.292𝛽+𝑜(𝛽)
operations. If we take sieving as a subroutine in the 𝛽-dimensional
sub-lattices inside of an 𝑛-dimensional lattice, the total BKZ- 𝛽cost
can be estimated by 8𝑛·20.292𝛽+12.31operations [ 5]. We recall the
following two definitions to evaluate the performance of lattice
algorithms.
Geometric Series Assumption (GSA) [19]. The geometric se-
ries assumption says that the norms of GSO vectors ∥b∗
𝑖∥in the
reduced basis decline geometrically with quotient 𝐹𝐺𝑆𝐴 such as
∥b∗
𝑖∥2/∥b∗
𝑖−1∥2=𝐹𝐺𝑆𝐴 for𝑖=1,...,𝑛 and𝐹𝐺𝑆𝐴∈[3/4,1). Here
𝐹𝐺𝑆𝐴 is called the GSA constant, whose size depends on the reduc-
tion algorithm and the corresponding parameter setting.
Root Hermite Factor (rHF) [10]. The root Hermite factor is de-
fined as:
𝛿=rHF(b1,..., b𝑛)=(∥b1∥/Vol(𝐿)1/𝑛)1/𝑛.
The rHF of a BKZ- 𝛽reduced basis Bof𝑑-dimensional lattice 𝐿(B)
can be evaluated by
𝛿=(((𝜋𝛽)1/𝛽𝛽)/(2𝜋𝑒))1
2(𝛽−1). (1)
This is proposed and practically verified by Chen in [9].
Generally, the quality of a lattice basis can be evaluated by ei-
ther the GSA constant 𝐹𝐺𝑆𝐴 or the rHF 𝛿. Further, by a simple
computation, we can get 𝐹𝐺𝑆𝐴≈𝛿−4when𝑛is large.
2016 Estimate [6]. The 2016 estimate for estimating the hardness
of LWE samples(A,b≡As+e(mod𝑞))∈Z𝑚×𝑛𝑞×Z𝑚𝑞states that
if the Gaussian heuristic and the GSA hold for BKZ- 𝛽reduced basis
andp
𝛽/𝑑·∥(e|1)∥≈p
𝛽𝜎≤𝛿2𝛽−𝑑·Vol(𝐿(A,𝑞))1/𝑑, (2)
then error ecan be found by BKZ- 𝛽reduction algorithm. It has
been widely used in the cryptanalysis [ 21] for lattice-based cryp-
toschemes: given the dimension 𝑑, the modular 𝑞and the standard
deviation𝜎ofe𝑖’s distribution, the 2016 estimate can output the
optimal blocksize 𝛽in the attack, by using equations (1) and (2).

plane algorithm by NP (t,B). It runs in polynomial time in the input
size.
2.4 Key Construction of Giophantus Schemes
Now we review the construction of public and private keys in
Giophantus schemes. First, two polynomials 𝑢𝑥(𝑡),𝑢𝑦(𝑡)inR𝑙,𝑛
are randomly chosen. Then an irreducible bivariate polynomial
𝑋(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)inR𝑞,𝑛[𝑥,𝑦]is sampled that it satisfies 𝑋(𝑡,𝑢𝑥,𝑢𝑦)=0
in𝑅𝑞,𝑛. The public key and the private key are given as follows:
Public Key : 𝑞,𝑙,𝑛,𝑋(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦);
Private Key : 𝑢𝑥(𝑡),𝑢𝑦(𝑡).
𝑟(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)∈R𝑞,𝑛[𝑥,𝑦]and𝑒(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)∈R𝑙,𝑛[𝑥,𝑦]are two perturba-
tions in encryption procedure. See [ 3] for the encryption/decreption
details of Giophantus schemes.
To make sure the decryption definitely succeed, 𝑞is set as
𝑞>𝑙−1+𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑥,𝑦𝑋+𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑥,𝑦𝑟Õ
𝑘=0(𝑘+1)𝑛𝑘(𝑙−1)(𝑘+1)
in Giophantus,
𝑞>2(⌈(𝑙−1)/2⌉+𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑥,𝑦𝑋+𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑥,𝑦𝑟Õ
𝑘=0(𝑘+1)𝑛𝑘⌈(𝑙−1)/2⌉(𝑘+1))
in Giophantus−, and
𝑞>2(⌈𝑙/2⌉+𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑥,𝑦𝑋+𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑥,𝑦𝑟Õ
𝑘=0(𝑘+1)𝑛𝑘⌈𝑙/2⌉𝑘+1)
in Giophantus+, respectively. The large gap of 𝑞>25bits and
𝑙<4bits in practical settings result in uSVP instances in the
cryptanalysis of Giophantus cryptoschemes.
2.5 Key Recovery Attack on Giophantus
Akiyama et al. proposed two attacks in [ 3], the linear algebraic
attack (LAA) and the key recovery attack (KRA), by using the
lattice structure associated with Giophantus. Intuitively, in KRA the
public key𝑋(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)is reduced to an RLWE sample where the secret
information and the perturbation are small. Giophantus schemes of
NIST PQC proposal and its variants adopt deg𝑥,𝑦𝑋=1, thus we can
write𝑋(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)=𝑎(𝑡)𝑥+𝑏(𝑡)𝑦+𝑐(𝑡). The coefficients 𝑎(𝑡)𝑏(𝑡)𝑐(𝑡)
of𝑋are all in𝑅𝑞,𝑛. Since gcd(𝑛,𝑞)=1, the polynomials 𝑡𝑛−1and
𝑡𝑛+1are square-free in 𝑅𝑞,𝑛. With a high probability, there exists
an inverse element in the ring 𝑅𝑞,𝑛. We suppose the inverse element
of𝑎(𝑡)exists and multiply 𝑎(𝑡)−1to𝑋. We can get 𝑋′(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)=𝑥+
𝑏′(𝑡)𝑦+𝑐′(𝑡), while the solution of 𝑋′(𝑡,𝑥,𝑦)=0is still(𝑢𝑥,𝑢𝑦)∈
𝑅𝑙,𝑛×𝑅𝑙,𝑛with small coefficients. This is substantially an RLWE
sample of(𝑏′(𝑡),−𝑐′(𝑡)=𝑏′(𝑡)𝑦+𝑥)∈𝑅𝑞,𝑛×𝑅𝑞,𝑛.
Next, we expand the available polynomials in RLWE sample to
vectors and matrix in LWE sample by the rotating operation, i.e. we
transform(𝑏′(𝑡),−𝑐′(𝑡)=𝑏′(𝑡)𝑦+𝑥)∈𝑅𝑞,𝑛×𝑅𝑞,𝑛to(B′,c′=
B′y+x)∈Z𝑛×𝑛𝑞×Z𝑛𝑞. Particularly, B′is a square matrix because
only one RLWE sample is available in the attack to Giophantus
schemes. The latter LWE sample is related to a 𝑞-ary lattice:
𝐿⊥
((I𝑛B′−c′),𝑞)={b∈Z𝑚|(I𝑛B′−c′)b≡0(mod𝑞)}.A basis Bof𝐿⊥can be presented by

¬, (4)
since B(−k yT1)𝑇=(x𝑇y𝑇1)𝑇for some vector k∈Z𝑛𝑞.
Consequently, we can recover the small solution of (𝑥,𝑦)=
(𝑢𝑥,𝑢𝑦)by solving the uSVP in the 𝑞-ary lattice𝐿(B)of dimension
2𝑛+1, namely finding the shortest vector (x𝑇y𝑇1)which is esti-
mated much shorter than the second shortest vector by Gaussian
heuristic.
3 ORIGINAL HYBRID ATTACK
In this section, we first review Odlyzko’s Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM)
attack on binary uSVP instances. Then we recall Howgrave-Graham’s
hybrid attack [ 14] which combines MitM and lattice algorithms:
lattice reduction algorithm and the nearest plane algorithm.
3.1 Meet-in-the-Middle Attack
Odlyzko’s Meet-in-the-Middle attack on binary NTRU scheme [ 13]
is discussed in [15]. In NTRU’s parameter settings, binary polyno-
mials𝑔,𝑓of degree𝑛−1are two private keys including 𝑑𝑔and
𝑑𝑓ones respectively, and polynomial ℎ=𝑔/𝑓∈𝑅−𝑞,𝑛(𝑞∈Z)is
the public key. The security of NTRU is based on the uSVP in the
2𝑛-dimensional lattice 𝐿constructed by a basis B=𝑞I𝑛H
0 I𝑛
, since
for some integer vectork
f
, we have
𝑞I𝑛H
0 I𝑛 k
f
=g
f
,
where His a circulant matrix generated from ℎ, i.e.H𝑖,𝑗=ℎ𝑖+𝑗mod𝑛.
The basis Bis called as an NTRU basis in the literature. Due to the
property such as(𝑓𝑥𝑖)ℎ=𝑔𝑥𝑖in the ring 𝑅−𝑞,𝑛,(gT,fT)and its
rotations(g(𝑖)T,f(𝑖)T)are all the solutions, where g(𝑖)andf(𝑖)are
vectors of coefficients in 𝑔𝑥𝑖and𝑓𝑥𝑖respectively. The determinant
det(𝐿(B))=𝑞𝑛and the norm of solutions isq
𝑑𝑓+𝑑𝑔; therefore,
(gT,fT)and its rotations are expected to be the shortest vector,
which are much shorter than other vectors, in 𝐿(B)by the Gaussian
heuristic. Namely, to recover the binary private key of NTRU is
equivalent to solve the uSVP in 𝐿(B).
Assume that 𝑑𝑓is even. In the MitM attack, we divide the secret
polynomial 𝑓by𝑓=𝑓1+𝑓2, with𝑑𝑓/2ones in𝑓1’s coefficients.
Then the coefficients of 𝑦1=𝑓1ℎand𝑦2=𝑓2ℎdiffer only by 0or1
because𝑦1+𝑦2=𝑔. The attacker randomly sample 𝑓1and compute
𝑦1=𝑓1ℎ. The polynomial 𝑓1is then stored into boxes addressed by
1○binary strings 𝑎𝑖=𝛽1:𝛽2:···:𝛽𝑛, where𝛽𝑗=𝛽𝑗(𝑦1)=1if
(𝑦1)𝑗>0and0otherwise; 2○binary strings ¯𝑎𝑖=¯𝛽1:¯𝛽2:···:¯𝛽𝑛
where ¯𝛽𝑗=1−𝛽𝑗. Because𝑦1=−𝑦2+𝑔and𝑔is binary, with high
probability we can get 𝛽𝑗(𝑦1)=𝛽𝑗(−𝑦2+𝑔)=1−𝛽𝑗(𝑦2), if𝑔does
not change the sign. Thus one pair of (𝑓1,𝑓2)of the solution 𝑓are
expected to be in the same box addressed by 𝑎1and ¯𝑎2. Here we
can store𝑓1into more boxes for the cases that 𝑔changes the sign of
𝛽(−𝑦2+𝑔). Accordingly, if there are already polynomial 𝑓2inside

store the sampled vector v1, the binary-addressed boxes associated
with x1are defined as follows. We note that by abuse of notation,
in the following two definitions, we denote by a𝑖(and x𝑖) the𝑖-th
element of the vector a(and x, respectively).

Furthermore, the following defined boxes can handle arbitrary

We show the hybrid attack in Algorithm 2. The success proba-
bility of the hybrid attack depends on two aspects:
(i) The probability 𝑝𝑠that the sampled vector v1is𝑠-admissible.
(ii) The probability 𝑝ℎthat the sampled v1is definitely part of the
correct solution, i.e. v1=v−v2for some vector v2.
We will discuss the calculation of these two probability in section 4.
Let𝑉denote the set of 𝑠-admissible vectors v1. A collision of
the same address is expected to occur after around |𝑉|1/2samples.
Consequently, the loop of Algorithm 2 is
𝐿#:=(𝑝𝑠·𝑝ℎ)−1|𝑉|1/2. (8)
This hybrid attack requires storage complexity of 𝑂(𝐿#). To esti-
mate the cost of an optimal hybrid attack, it is important to evaluate
the parameters so as to handle the trade-off between reduction al-
gorithm and MitM attack. In the next section, we propose such a
simulator for the hybrid attack.
4 OUR PROPOSED SIMULATOR
In this section, we propose a feasible simulator that can dynam-
ically estimate the cost of a hybrid attack, taking into account
trade-off between the cost of exponential lattice reduction and
exponential MitM attack. We then apply the simulator to Giophan-
tus, Giophantus+and Giophantus−, by reducing their underlying
Diophantine equation to the unique shortest vector problem.
4.1 A Simulator of Hybrid Attack
We show our simulator in Algorithm 3 and explain how it works.
The goal of this simulator is to estimate the minimal practical cost
of hybrid attack on the uSVP in a 𝑞-ary lattice 𝐿(B). Assume the
shortest vector is b=(b1,..., b𝑁), where𝑁is the dimension of
𝐿(B). Denote by 𝜎the standard deviation of b𝑖’s distribution 𝐷𝑁𝜎.
By a simple computation using Gaussian heuristic, finding bin𝐿(B)
is certainly a uSVP instance when given 𝜎is small and 𝑁is large.
The inputs for our simulator are (𝑁,𝑞,𝜎)and a bound[𝑚1,𝑚2]
for the dimension of the sub-lattice in the reduction part, where
⌈𝑁/2⌋<𝑚1<𝑚2<𝑁.Algorithm 3 Simulator to estimate the optimal hybrid attack cost.
Input: dimension𝑁of𝐿(B), modulus𝑞, standard deviation 𝜎,
and bound of dimension of sublattice 𝑚∈[𝑚1,𝑚2];
Output: minimum total cost 𝐶and the corresponding optimal 𝑟′,
𝛽in the hybrid attack on 𝐿(B).

First, we generate an upper bound 𝛽1by the 2016 estimate, for
the required blocksize when applying the BKZ reduction to the full
basis B. Note that we heuristically test from 𝛽1−100to𝛽1(step 2)
in our simulator, which experientially cover the possible optimal 𝛽.
We assume that Bis reduced to a new basis Dby BKZ-𝛽algorithm.
The QR-decomposition of Dis the same as equation (5), where the
first𝑟′vectors are of norm 𝑞, the last𝑟vectors are of norm 1, and
there are𝑟𝑌:=𝑁−𝑟−𝑟′vectors at the rest middle part. Denote
by𝑚=𝑟′+𝑟𝑌the dimension of the sub-lattice being reduced. For
the sake of convenience, we show the hybrid model in Figure 2.
In our simulator, we use the assumption of GSA and the property
that the volume of lattice does not change during the reduction, i.e.

Then the cost 𝐶BKZ-𝛽of the BKZ reduction part can be computed
easily at step 10. To evaluate the cost 𝐶MitM of the MitM, we should
carefully calculate the two probability introduced in subsection 3.2:
𝑝𝑠of sampling v1a𝑠-admissible vector; and 𝑝ℎthatv1is part of
the correct solution.
To compute the former 𝑝𝑠, we refer to the methodology used
in [14]. Namely, we reduce the problem of estimating 𝑝𝑠to the
problem of evaluating the probability distribution of coordinates
𝛾𝑖ofs′=Y′g′where Y′∈R(𝑚−𝑟)×(𝑚−𝑟)is orthonormal matrix as
defined in subsection 3.2, and separate the solution as (g𝑇f𝑇)=
(g𝑇𝑟g′𝑇f′𝑇). We assume the expected norm of g′is𝑑, thus∥g′∥∞≤
𝑑, i.e.|𝛾𝑖| ≤𝑑for𝑟+1≤𝑖≤𝑚−𝑟. Denote by 𝑝𝑑(𝜃,𝜃′)the
probability that 𝜃≤|𝛾𝑖|<𝜃′and we divide the interval [0,𝑑]into
𝐾sections as 0=𝜃1<𝜃2<···<𝜃𝐾=𝑑. Then we have

𝑝𝑑(𝜃𝑘,𝜃𝑘+1)!
Here𝑒𝑖=((𝛼−1)𝑖+(𝑚−𝛼𝑟))/(𝑚−𝑟)is calculated by GSA.
Meanwhile, depending on different distributions of the solution, 𝑝ℎ
should be calculated case by case. We show how to compute 𝑝ℎin
the analysis of Giophantus cryptoschemes in subsection 4.2.
If the solution in Algorithm 3 is an arbitrary vector binstead of
the binary one, it is suggested to sample the elements of v1from
[−𝑘,𝑘]where𝑘=∥b∥∞[22]. However, due to the computation
result in Table 1, sampling v1from[−⌈𝑘/2⌋,⌈𝑘/2⌋]seems more
practical according to a calculation for Giophantus key recovery
attack.
Moreover, the orthonormal matrix Y′can be generated from a
random matrix Bby QR-decomposition. We test how the different
types of B∈Z(𝑚−𝑟)×(𝑚−𝑟)
𝑞 can affect on the results of 𝑝𝑠: using the
original sampled basis BinZ100×100𝑞 by modulus 𝑞=761, applying
LLL and BKZ reduction algorithms to B, and sampling Bby larger
modulus𝑞=695069. For each case, we repeat 1000 times and takev1∈{−1,0,1,2}v1∈{−1,0,1}

the average value. The experimental results in Figure 3 show that
𝑝𝑑(𝜃,𝜃′)are close to each other. For this reason, we can generate
Y′from a random B∈Z(𝑚−𝑟)×(𝑚−𝑟)
𝑞 with a small 𝑞.
Figure 3: Test 𝑝𝑠with respect to different types of bases in
Z100×100𝑞 used in the simulator. The size of modulus 𝑞and
the type of bases almost do not affect evaluating 𝑝𝑠.
After preparing the above two probability, we can compute the
number of loops 𝐿#for the guessing part by equation (8). Further-
more, in each loop, the candidates in the boxes are checked by
multiplying Y−1. Hence we estimate the total cost for the part of
MitM attack by
𝐶𝑀𝑖𝑡𝑀 =𝑚2𝐿#. (11)
Note that this estimation is conservative. Consequently, we can
test the total cost 𝐶of the hybrid attack dynamically for each
𝛽1−100<𝛽<𝛽1and𝑚1<𝑚<𝑚2. Incidentally, we terminate
the loop heuristically at step 19 when there is no smaller cost arises
after 40 iterations.
4.2 Cryptanalysis on Giophantus and its
Variants
As we introduced in subsection 2.5, one can recover the private key

a uSVP in Giophantus matrix (4) in Z(2𝑛+1)×( 2𝑛+1)

and𝑞≫𝑙are used in the proposals. We apply our hybrid attack
simulator to analyze the parameters proposed in Giophantus [ 3],
Giophantus+[16] and Giophantus−[4], respectively. Although the
coefficients of the secret polynomial are in the set of {−1,0,1,2},
we sample the coordinates of v1in{−1,0,1}due to the analysis in

We show the simulation results in Table 2. It is known in all the
cases that𝑁=2𝑛+1and the standard deviation of the solution
is𝜎=1.12.(𝑛,𝑞)are the proposed parameter sets. The “claimed
security levels”correspond to the security categories of NIST PQC
standardization project, e.g. breaking the AES-128 security requires
attackers’ efforts of 143 bits operations at least. We also show the
optimal parameters and the costs for each part in the hybrid attack.
In particular, the final total cost of 𝐶𝐻indicates that the security
levels of Giophantus are expected to be reduced by at most 19 bits
using the hybrid attack. Simultaneously, the claimed security levels
for Giophantus+and Giophantus−are ensured against the hybrid
attack.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a hybrid attack simulator against the
unique Shortest Vector Problem (uSVP). Our algorithm can trade
off the cost between the lattice reduction part and the guessing
part of MitM attack. Our simulation results for the cryptoschemes
Giophantus [ 3], Giophantus+[16] and Giophantus−[4] show that
by the hybrid attack, the security level is reduced by at most 19
bits for Giophantus’ parameters proposed in NIST Post Quantum
Cryptography (PQC) standardization 1st round submission, and the
parameter sets of Giophantus+and Giophantus−are secure against
the hybrid attack.
