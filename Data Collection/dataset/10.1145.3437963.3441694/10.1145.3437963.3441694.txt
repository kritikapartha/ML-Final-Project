ABSTRACT
Modern search engines retrieve results mainly based on the key-
word matching techniques, and thus fail to answer analytical queries
like “apps with more than 1 billion monthly active users” or “popula-
tion growth of the US from 2015 to 2019”, which requires numerical
reasoning or aggregating results from multiple web pages. Such
analytical queries are very common in the data analysis area, the
expected results would be structured tables or charts. In most cases,
these structured results are not available or accessible, they scat-
ter in various text sources. In this work, we build AnaSearch, a
search system to support analytical queries, and return structured
results that can be visualized in the form of tables or charts. We
collect and build structured quantitative data from the unstruc-
tured text on the web automatically. With AnaSearch, data analysts
could easily derive insights for decision making with keyword or
natural language queries. Specifically, we build AnaSearch under
the COVID-19 news data, which makes it easy to compare with
manually collected structured data.

1 INTRODUCTION
Modern search engines like Google or Bing consider user queries
as simple keywords, and retrieve a ranked list of web pages as
the search result. By leveraging techniques in information extrac-
tion, question answering, and knowledge graphs, search engines
now are also capable of retrieving information from structured or
semi-structured data sources, like tables on the web or pre-built
knowledge graphs. For example, Google can return a list of enti-
ties for queries with entity type description like “2019 Nobel prize
winners”.
However, modern search engines usually fail to answer ana-
lytical queries that require numerical reasoning, or aggregating

906results from multiple web pages. Consider the following examples
of analytical queries:
•Companies with PE Ratio lower than 10.
•GDP of the US, EU and China in recent 5 years.
•Monthly active user of TikTok in the past three months.
These queries usually contain quantities, entities, and time expres-
sions, which aim to acquire the data of a specific case or event.
Search engines fail to answer these queries and return web pages
instead. Taking the third query as an example, one way to achieve
the expected results with a modern search engine is to split the orig-
inal query into multiple queries, like “Monthly active user of TikTok
in August”, and manually collect the results for each split query. To
support these analytical queries, in most cases, we need to extract
quantitative related information, and aggregate the extracted results
from multiple web pages to build the structured data. In this demo,
we build AnaSearch to retrieve and visualize quantitative structured
data for analytical queries. The structured data is automatically con-
structed from unstructured text. Figure 1 is an overview of analyti-
cal query processing and retrieval in AnaSearch. With AnaSearch,
data analysts could easily derive insights for decision making with
keywords or natural language queries. Specifically, the prototype
system presented in this demo paper is built on the news data of
the COVID-19 pandemic. One benefit is that we could verify the
effectiveness of AnaSearch with manually collected golden data, for
example, the COVID-19 tracker from Johns Hopkins University1
and Bing2. The demo is available at http://aka.ms/anasearch.
2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
AnaSearch consists of three main phases: quantitative data ex-
traction, query parsing & retrieval, and data visualization. In this
section, we will introduce quantitative data extraction and query
parsing & retrieval, as is shown in Figure 2. Data visualization will
be described in Section 3.
2.1 Quantitative Data Extraction
We build AnaSearch upon news data, which is formatted as title,
content, URL, and published time. For each document, we extract
numerical values with Recognizers-Text3, and perform entity linking
with the Text Analytics API4.
For each numerical value, we extract quantitative facts as a triple
of<related, value &unit, time>based on the constituency pars-
ing tree. related is the quantitative related information, including
what the value measures (denoted as quantified ), and entities that
influence or motivate the value ;value is the numerical value with a
resolution (exact, approximate, upper/lower bound and interval);
time is the time when a quantity takes on a particular value, note
that it could be different from the published time.
Constituency parsing breaks text into constituent or tokens
based on the phrase structure grammar. One observation is that
for a given numerical value, the quantitative facts are usually its
siblings or siblings of its ancestors in the constituency parsing
tree. Thus, we could search on the constituency tree to extract the

“related ” part. The values (with units ) and the normalized time ex-
pressions can be extracted by Recognizers-Text. In the constituency
parse tree, we consider a non-terminal node as a “value node” or
“time node” if it contains a value or time expression. We further
define “value mention” as the bottom level value node.
related Extraction: related consists of what the value measures
(quantified ) and entities that influence or motivate the value. quan-
tified should be close to the value mention. We extract quantified
as 1) nouns with their modifiers right to the value, 2) sibling noun
phrases (NPs) of the value mention, and all its ancestor value nodes.
We further merge the words and phrases that are adjacent in the
original text as the quantified. To extract entities that influence
or motivate the values, we first extract the least verb phrase (VP)
ancestor of the value mention as the predicate of the sentence, then
extract the left closest sibling NP node of the predicate as the entity
candidates. Sentences are filtered out if the entity candidates are
not linked with known entities by the entity linking API.
time Extraction: There are quite a lot of time expressions like “last
week”, “on Tuesday”, “in the last 24 hours”. Recognizers-Text could
only extract and normalize formal time expressions. We design a
simple rule-based approach to resolve and normalize the above time
expression. For example, given the published time “2020-09-23” and
“on Monday” in the news, we will resolve “Monday” to “2020-09-21”.
2.2 Query Parsing & Retrieval
Query Parsing. AnaSearch supports two types of queries: entity-
based query and quantity-based query. The entity-based query is
parsed into <E∗,X∗, 𝑑∗>, where:
•E∗is the entity condition, which is a set of entities in the
query obtained through the Text Analytics API.
•𝑑∗is the time condition, which can be time or time range
extracted with Recognizers-Text from the query.
•X∗is the context condition, which is similar to the context
defined in QSearch [ 6].X∗is a set of remaining nouns or
noun phrases of the query with entity and time removed.
For example, “Sales of Tesla Model S and BMW i8 in 2019.” is an
entity-based query where E∗={Tesla Model S ,BMW i8},X∗=
{Sales}, and 𝑑∗=2019. The result is a collection of numerical values
for each mentioned entity in E∗, which could be visualized in a
table or chart.

907The quantity-based query denoted by <𝑞∗, 𝑡∗,X∗, 𝑑∗>is similar
to the query defined in QSearch [6], where:
•𝑞∗is the quantity condition which consists of a value, a com-
parison operator (exact, approximate, upper/lower bound
and interval), and a unit. We employ the quantitative fact
extraction method introduced in Section 2.1 to extract 𝑞∗
from the query.
•𝑡∗is the specified entity type, which is extracted with a
dictionary of entity types from YAGO [11].
•X∗and𝑑∗are the context and time conditions, respectively.
The extractions of X∗and𝑑∗are the same as in entity-based
queries.
Given an example quantity-based query “cars with sales over 5,000
in April”, the quantity condition 𝑞∗is(5,000,+∞), the semantic
type 𝑡∗is𝑐𝑎𝑟, the context condition X∗will be{𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠}, and the time
condition 𝑑∗is 2020-04. The results of a quantity-based query are
usually a collection of entities with type 𝑡∗that satisfy the quantity
condition 𝑞∗, the context condition X∗, and the time condition 𝑑∗.
Data Retrieval. For an entity-based query <E∗,X∗, 𝑑∗>, we re-
trieve quantitative facts with 1) entity matching, 2) context match-
ing, and 3) time matching.
For entity matching, we only consider those quantitative facts
whose entity of the related are in E∗. For context matching, we
obtain the context Xfor each quantitative fact by selecting the non-
entity nouns or noun phrases of related. To ensure the relevance
between X∗andX, we consider a quantitative fact related to the
query if X∗overlaps with Xor the semantic similarity of XandX∗
is above the threshold. For time matching, we filter out quantitative
facts of which the time does not satisfy the time condition 𝑡∗.
For a quantity-based query <𝑞∗, 𝑡∗,X∗, 𝑑∗>, the matching pro-
cess will be 1) quantity matching, 2) entity type matching, 3) con-
text matching, and 4) time matching. The context and time match-
ing methods for entity-based queries also apply to quantity-based
queries.
For quantity matching, we require that the value &unit from
quantitative facts satisfy the quantity condition 𝑞∗. It should be
noted that the unit should be comparable and the value should
satisfy the comparison operator. For example, “$6,000” satisfies the
quantity condition “more than $5000”. For entity type matching,
we only retrieve those quantitative facts whose entity of the related
has type 𝑡∗. We use the type information from YAGO [ 11] to obtain
the entity types for the linked entities.
There might be duplicated or inconsistent values for the same
entity, time, and context X(exactly or semantically the same) among
the candidate results retrieved from multiple sources. We group the
candidate results by the entity, time, and context X. For each group,
we simply choose the value with the most occurrences as the final
result <entity, time, context X,value >.
3 DEMONSTRATION
We build the prototype of AnaSearch on the COVID-19 news data.
For COVID-19, the most frequent quantified topics are confirmed
cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Therefore, we filter out quanti-
tative facts that are not related to these three quantified topics, and
we use a predefined keyword list to map the quantitative facts and
the user input query to the following COVID-19 types : confirmedtotal, confirmed change, recovered total, recovered change, death
total, and death change, where “change” means the change of the
quantified topics for a given time range. Figure 3 shows the home-
page of AnaSearch on COVID-19, Figure 4 is the result page of two
example entity-based queries. Throughout this paper, we mainly
demonstrate the entity-based queries, the quantity-based queries
are similar to QSearch [7], and thus are omitted.
Query Parsing Visualization. For entity-based queries on COVID-
19, the entities mainly refer to the locations, like names of countries,
states, or cities. The context Xis mapped to the COVID-19 types.
For the query “How many cases and deaths have Israel reported by
April 21st?” shown in Figure 4, the parsed query (each condition) is
displayed under the search box labeled with entity, COVID-19 type
from context, and time.
Structured Results Visualization. The structured results are vi-
sualized in table and chart (page 1 is the table view and page 2 is
the chart view in Figure 4). The table view shows the values of the
quantified COVID-19 types for each location (entity ) and date (time ).
For the chart view, we design two types of charts. A line chart is
adopted when the time condition is date range or multiple dates,
such as Query 1 in Figure 4, each chart represents the structured
results of one location. A bar chart is adopted if the time condi-
tion of the query is a single date, see Query 2 in Figure 4. Users
could switch the COVID-19 types by clicking on the selection menu
(marked as “Click to change the COVID-19 type ” in Figure 4). As a
reference, we also show the manually collected data from the Bing
COVID-19 tracker. The total amount and correct amount of values
are displayed on the top right-hand corner. For results displayed in
table form, values marked with a green box are correct ones while
incorrect ones are marked with a red box. For results displayed in a
chart, we draw another series representing the manually collected
data from the Bing tracker for comparison.
By clicking on rows from the table or data points from the chart
(marked as “Click to view original news” in Figure 4), the original
text of the extracted quantitative fact is shown, which contains the
entity (linked to Wikipedia page) and a text snippet from where the
quantitative facts are extracted. The entity, value & unit, time and
context Xare shown in different colors. We further allow users to
check different links for the same text snippet by clicking on each
original text (marked as “Click to view links” in Figure 4).

4 RELATED WORK
Our work is related to 1) quantitative information extraction and 2)
semantic search. The output of quantitative information extraction
is structured quantitative facts. Prior work focuses on recognizing
and extracting quantitative information with dependency pattern
matching [ 8,10], phrase chunking [ 1], and sequence tagging tech-
niques [ 6]. We extract quantitative facts mainly by searching on
the constituent parsing tree, which is simple yet effective.
From semantic search, our work is related to studies like search-
ing entities starting from a type description or an entity name
(e.g. [ 2–5]), and answering queries with quantities from text [ 7].
Compared to these studies, the main difference is that our work
supports analytical queries and return structured results that can be
visualized in tables/charts. Building and visualizing structured data
have been studied by prior work like DeepTrack [ 9]. But such work
lacks information retrieval abilities and is limited to building and
visualizing Spatio-temporal data from both structured and unstruc-
tured text. Our work supports extracting and retrieving structured
results from unstructured text.
5 CONCLUSION
We propose AnaSearch to extract, retrieve, and visualize structured
data from the unstructured text for analytical queries. We build
the prototype of AnaSearch on the COVID-19 news data. For fu-
ture work, we will improve the quantitative information extraction
approach and the ranking part of the result retrieval.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
