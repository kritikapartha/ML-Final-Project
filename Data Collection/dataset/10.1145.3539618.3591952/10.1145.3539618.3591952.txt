ABSTRACT
Effective cross-lingual dense retrieval methods that rely on multi-
lingual pre-trained language models (PLMs) need to be trained
to encompass both the relevance matching task and the cross-
language alignment task. However, cross-lingual data for training
is often scarcely available. In this paper, rather than using more
cross-lingual data for training, we propose to use cross-lingual
query generation to augment passage representations with qu-
eries in languages other than the original passage language. These
augmented representations are used at inference time so that the
representation can encode more information across the different
target languages. Training of a cross-lingual query generator does
not require additional training data to that used for the dense re-
triever. The query generator training is also effective because the
pre-training task for the generator (T5 text-to-text training) is very
similar to the fine-tuning task (generation of a query). The use of
the generator does not increase query latency at inference and can
be combined with any cross-lingual dense retrieval method. Results
from experiments on a benchmark cross-lingual information re-
trieval dataset show that our approach can improve the effectiveness
of existing cross-lingual dense retrieval methods. Implementation of
our methods, along with all generated query files are made publicly
available at https://github.com/ielab/xQG4xDR.

Pre-trained language model-based (PLM) dense retrievers (DRs)
have achieved remarkable success in the task of English-only passage
retrieval [ 12–14,20,21,26,28,29,40,43,44]. These models use a
dual-encoder architecture that encodes both queries and passages
with a PLM encoder into dense embeddings. They then perform
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching in the embedding
space. Compared to traditional bag-of-words approaches, DRs benefit
from semantic soft matching, which helps overcome the problem
of word mismatch in passage retrieval [33, 45].
To leverage the semantic modelling power of DRs, recent research
has extended English-only DRs to support cross-lingual settings [ 1,
2,19,22,27,31], i.e, where queries and passages are in different
languages. This is achieved using multi-lingual PLMs, such as mul-
tilingual BERT [ 6], in place of the English-only PLMs. This ap-
proach is particularly important in this setting where traditional
bag-of-words methods are ineffective due to the limited number
of matching terms across languages. In contrast, cross-lingual DRs
(xDRs) are able to encode queries and passages in different languages
into a shared embedding space, enabling efficient ANN search
across languages. However, such multi-lingual PLM-based xDRs
usually are less effective on the cross-lingual passage retrieval task
than DRs in the English-only setting [ 1]. The hypothesis to explain
this result is that, in the English-only setting, a DR only needs to
learn relevance matching between queries and passages. In contrast,
a xDR not only needs to learn the relevance matching task, but
also needs to learn how to align the embeddings of texts with
similar semantic meaning but in different language [ 24,41]. It is
this language gap that makes cross lingual retrieval a relatively
harder task for xDRs.
Based on this hypothesis, this paper proposes the use of cross-
lingual query generation (xQG) to bridge the language gap for xDRs.
Our approach is illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, we fine-tune a
multilingual T5 (mT5) model using language-specific prompts to
generate several queries per passage for each target language. In
the indexing phase, we use a given xDR model to encode passages
and their associated generated queries in different languages into
embeddings. Finally, we augment the original passage embeddings
with the embeddings of the generated queries before adding them
to the ANN index. By doing so, we move the passage embeddings
to a space that is closer to the target user query language. Our
approach does not add extra query latency and can be applied to
any existing xDRs.

Cross-lingual dense retrievers. The development of cross-lingual
pre-trained language models has significantly contributed to the
progress of cross-lingual dense retrieval (xDR) [ 4,5,8,39]. Notable

examples of recent xDR methods include CORA [ 2], which employs
a generator to facilitate retrieval training data mining, Sentri [ 31],
which proposes a single encoder and self-training, and DR.DECR [ 19],
which utilizes parallel queries and sentences for cross-lingual knowl-
edge distillation. Among these, our work is most closely related
to QuiCK [27], which also utilizes a cross-lingual query generator
for xDR. However, unlike QuiCK, which uses the xQG as a teacher
model in knowledge distillation for xDR in the training phase, our
method directly augments passage embeddings with xQG queries
without any xDR training involved.
Query generation for information retrieval. Query generation
is a well-established technique that has been widely used to improve
retrieval performance in various retrieval models [ 11,25]. In addition,
it has been shown to be effective for domain adaptation in dense
passage retrieval tasks [ 23,32,34], as well as for enhancing the
effectiveness of other PLM-based rankers [ 37,48]. In our approach,
we also rely on a query generation model to generate high-quality
queries for downstream passage embedding augmentation tasks.
Augmenting embeddings for dense retrievers. Our method
relies on effectively augmenting representations encoded by DR
encoders – a direction recently explored also by other works. For
instance, Li et al . [16,17]use the top retrieved passages as pseudo-
relevant feedback to augment query embeddings using the Rocchio
aggregation function. Similarly, Zhuang et al . [47] extend this idea
by using embeddings of clicked passages to augment query em-
beddings. Other PRF methods have also been extensively researched
to enhance both English-only dense retrieval [ 18,35,36,42,46]
and cross-lingual dense retrieval [ 3]. On the other hand, the HyDE
method uses large pre-trained language models to generate hypo-
thetical passages for a given query and directly uses the embedding
of the hypothetical passage to perform the search [ 9]. While all
these works focus on augmenting query embeddings for DRs at
query time, our work focuses on augmenting passage embeddings
at indexing time, thereby avoiding the extra overhead in terms of
query latency.
3 METHOD
Our approach consists of two components: (1) a cross-lingual query
generation model that, for each passage, generates high-quality
queries in different languages, and (2) an embedding aggregation
function that augments the original passage embedding with the
embeddings of the generated queries.
To obtain a xQG model, we fine-tune a mT5 model with labeled
relevant(𝑞𝑡, 𝑝)pairs, where 𝑡is the target query language. We use
a seq2seq objective akin to docTquery-T5’s objective [ 25]; in our
case the input is the passage text with language-specific prompts:
prompt(𝑡, 𝑝)=Generate a[𝑡]question for this passage: [𝑝],(1)where[𝑡]and[𝑝]are prompt placeholders for the target language
and passage text, respectively. Once we have trained a xQG model,
we can generate a set of queries for each target language and
passage by replacing the placeholders accordingly:
𝑄𝑝=Ø
𝑡∈𝑇𝑄𝑡
𝑝;𝑄𝑡
𝑝=xQG(prompt(𝑡, 𝑝))× 𝑛, (2)
where 𝑇is the target language set and 𝑄𝑝is the set of all generated
queries for passage 𝑝which includes 𝑛generated queries for each
target language. In our experiments, we use a top- 𝑘sampling
scheme [ 7] to generate queries, and set 𝑘=10. We find that these
simple language-specific prompts can effectively lead the T5 model
to generate the desired output in that language.
For the embedding aggregation function, we use a Rocchio-
like aggregation function that is similar to previous works that
aggregated dense representations [ 16,47]. We use this aggregation
function to obtain the embeddings of all passages in the corpus:
𝑒𝑚𝑏(𝑝, 𝑄𝑝, 𝜃, 𝛼)=(1−𝛼)·𝜃(𝑝)+𝛼∑︁
ˆ𝑞𝑡∈𝑄𝑝𝜃(ˆ𝑞𝑡), (3)
where ˆ𝑞𝑡is a generated query for target language 𝑡,𝜃is the xDR
encoder model and 𝜃(.)is the text embedding given by the xDR
encoder. The hyper-parameter 𝛼is the augmentation ratio, 𝛼∈
[0,1]. This ratio is used to control the weights assigned to the
original passage embedding and the generated query embeddings.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
We design our experiments to answer the research questions:
RQ1: How does the number of generated queries affect xDR ef-
fectiveness?
RQ2: How does the augmentation ratio 𝛼impact xDR effective-
ness?
RQ3: How do the queries generated for each language impact xDR
effectiveness?
Datasets and Evaluation. We train and evaluate our approach on
XOR-TyDi [ 1], a cross-lingual open retrieval question answering
benchmark dataset. The dataset contains approximately 15k an-
notated relevant passage-query pairs in the training set and 2k
passage-answer pairs in the dev set. Queries in both the train and
dev sets are in seven typologically diverse languages (Ar, Bn, Fi, Ja,
Ko, Ru, and Te), while passages are in English. There are about 18M
passages in the corpus. We use the training set to train both the
xQG model and the xDRs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our ap-
proach and baselines using recall at 𝑚kilo-tokens (R@ 𝑚kt), which
is the dataset’s official evaluation metric. This metric computes
the fraction of queries for which the minimal answer is contained
in the top 𝑚tokens of the retrieved passages. We consider 𝑚=

Baselines. Following common practice on XOR-TyDi [ 1], we
adapt DPR [ 14] to the cross-lingual setting by initializing it with
different multilingual pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifi-
cally, in our experiments we use the multilingual variants of BERT [ 6]
(mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa [ 5] (XLM-R) for this purpose. In
addition to the standard supervised baselines, we also explore how
our xQG embedding augmentation approach can improve a zero-
shot xDR model, where the xDR is initialized with mBERT but it
is trained with English only passage-query pairs and is directly
applied to the XOR-TyDi cross-lingual retrieval task.
Implementation details. We initialize our xQG model with the
multilingual T5-base checkpoint provided by Google1and available
in the Huggingface library [ 38]. We fine-tune this checkpoint with
the passage-query pairs in the XOR-TyDi training set. We train
the xQG model for 1600 steps using a batch size of 128 and a
learning rate of 1e-4. After training, we generate 5 queries per
passage for each target language, resulting in about 7 * 5 * 18M
= 630M generated queries in total. We use four A100 GPUs to
generate all queries; this process took about 70 hours to complete.
We release our generated queries on the Huggingface hub2to
allow the community to reuse this resource [ 30]. For training the
xDRs, we use the Tevatron dense retriever training toolkit [ 10],
which uses with BM25 hard negative passages. We train the xDRs
with a batch size of 128, initializing them with mBERT base3or
XLM-R base4checkpoints and training them on the XOR-TyDi
training set for 40 epochs. For each training sample, we set the
number of hard negative passages in the contrastive loss to 7 and
applied in-batch negatives training. We use a learning rate of 1e-5
for mBERT-based xDRs and of 2e-5 for XLM-R-based xDRs. For
the zero-shot xDR, we use the same training configurations as for
the mBERT-based xDR trained on XOR-TyDi but using the Natural
Questions (NQ) training data [ 15] which contains English-only
query-passage training samples.

5 RESULTS
5.1 Main results
Table 1 presents the effectiveness of xDR models initialized with
the XLM-R and mBERT backbone PLMs and trained on the XOR-
TyDi dataset. Zero-shot denotes the models trained only on the
English subset of the NQ dataset. In these experiments, we use all
the queries generated by our xQG and set the augmentation ratio
to𝛼=0.01for augmenting the passage embeddings of the xDRs.
For the R@2kt metric, the xDR initialized with mBERT out-
performs the xDR initialized with XLM-R, achieving an average
R@2kt score of 44.1, while XLM-R achieves an average score of 27.5.
Our xQG passage embedding augmentation approach improves
the XLM-R xDR, achieving an average score of 29.8, which is a
statistically significant improvement compared to its baseline effect-
iveness ( 𝑝<0.05). Similarly, mBERT’s effectiveness improves with
xQG, achieving an average score of 46.2, which is also a statistically
significant improvement compared to its corresponding baseline
(𝑝<0.05). The zero-shot mBERT model achieves an average R@2kt
of 33.0; this also improves when combined with xQG, achieving an
average score of 36.0. This improvement is statistically significant
(𝑝<0.05). Similar trends are found for R@5kt. Overall, we find
that our xQG can significantly improve all investigated xDR models.

Figure 3: Impact of the augmentation ratio 𝛼. Scores are averaged
across all languages. Statistical significant improvements over no
augmentation ( 𝛼=0) are labelled with stars ( 𝑝<0.05).
In terms of per language effectiveness, xQG improves almost all
models across all languages with the exceptions of mBERT’s R@2kt
for Japanese (Ja) and mBERT’s R@5kt for Finnish (Fi).
In summary, mBERT performs better than XLM-R for both R@2kt
and R@5kt. The use of xQG embedding augmentation statistically
significantly improves the effectiveness of both backbones.
5.2 RQ1: Impact of number of generated queries
Figure 2 reports the impact of using different amounts of generated
queries to augment passage embeddings when using mBERT xDR.
The results suggest that using more generated queries is beneficial
for both R@2tk and R@5tk. The improvements become statistically
significant when 4 or more generated queries are used for each
target language. While the curves do not plateau, indicating that
using even more generated queries could further improve the effect-
iveness, our experiments were limited to up to 5 generated queries
per target language due to computational constraints.
5.3 RQ2: Impact of augmentation ratio
We report the impact of the augmentation ratio 𝛼on the effective-
ness of xDR in Figure 3. Higher values of 𝛼correspond to assigning
more weight to the generated query embeddings during embedding
aggregation, and 𝛼=0corresponds to no augmentation. As shown
in the figure, even a small value of 𝛼(0.01) leads to a significant
improvement in both R@2kt and R@5kt. The best effectiveness is
achieved when 𝛼=0.02. However, using higher values of 𝛼does
not result in further improvements – rather, it can even hurt the
effectiveness when 𝛼>0.05. Based on these results, we conclude
that the augmentation ratio in our embedding aggregation function
has a significant impact on the effectiveness of xDR, and using a
small value of 𝛼can be beneficial for improving effectiveness.
5.4 RQ3: Impact of each languages
In the previous experiments we used all the queries generated for a
passage to augment the original passage embedding, irrespective of
language of the generated query. Next, we investigate the impact on
effectiveness of using generated queries from each of the languages
separately. We analyze this in Figure 4, where we plot R@2kt for
each target language (rows) against different values of 𝛼(x-axis).
The plots in the diagonal show that xDR effectiveness improves
when passage embeddings are augmented with generated queries
Figure 4: R@2kt for target languages (rows) augmented by source
generated queries (columns). We plot 𝛼from 0 to 0.1 with step size
of 0.01 (x axis). Statistically significant better results with respect to
no augmentation ( 𝛼=0) are labelled with stars ( 𝑝<0.05).
for the same language. Notably, we observe that the best value of 𝛼
varies across different languages, and the improvements in effective-
ness are not always statistically significant. We also observe that, for
some languages, queries generated for other languages can improve
the effectiveness of target queries in a different language. For
instance, using queries generated for Japanese (Ja) can improve the
effectiveness of target queries in Korean (ko), while using Russian
(Ru) generated queries can help target queries in Telugu (Te). These
results suggest that the embeddings of the queries generated for
any single language potentially can also provide useful information
for target queries in other languages.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we propose a passage embedding augmentation ap-
proach to enhance the effectiveness of cross-lingual DRs. Our
method can be applied to any cross-lingual DR and it requires
no further DR training nor changes to the retrieval pipeline. We
empirically showed the method is effective for the cross-lingual DPR
method across different backbones. However, a limitation of our
empirical investigation is that we did not evaluate the method across
other dense retriever architectures. We leave the extension of this
investigation to future work. We also note that our approach relies
on a xQG model that can generate high quality queries. However,
a recent work has shown that T5-based query generation is prone
to hallucination and that along with highly effective queries, the
generator also produces poor queries that negatively impact re-
trieval effectiveness [ 11]. They then propose the use of a cross-
encoder ranker to filter out some ineffective generated queries; this
practice can further improve effectiveness. We leave the adaptation
of this approach in our xQG setting to future work.
