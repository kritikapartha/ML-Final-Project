ABSTRACT
The HAPTIC2/HEPTAD User Toolkit (HUT) enables B-cell epitope
prediction online (https://freeshell.de/badong/hut.htm) to support
vaccine and other health R&D but largely neglects solvent-system
effects on paratope-epitope binding. This work thus provides the
HAPTIC3/HEPTAD2 User Toolkit (HUT2), which comprises the
HAPTIC3/HEPTAD2 Input Preprocessor (HIP2), the Heuristic
Affinity Prediction Tool for Immune Complexes 3 (HAPTIC3), the
HAPTIC3-like Epitope Prediction Tool for Antigen with Disulfide
(HEPTAD2) and the Solvent-parameter Estimation Tool for HAP-
TIC3/HEPTAD2 (SETH). HIP2, HAPTIC3 and HEPTAD2 replace the
HUT components HIP, HAPTIC2 and HEPTAD, respectively. HIP2
tags hydrophobic blobs, ordered regions and glycosylation sites
(like HIP) as well as collapse- and/or aggregation-prone sequence
segments poor in both proline and charged residues, for exclusion
from downstream analyses by HAPTIC3 and HEPTAD2. HAPTIC3
estimates free-energy changes for paratope binding to variable-
length disordered peptidic sequences by resolving said binding into
processes of epitope compaction, collapse and contact (like HAP-
TIC2), but modeling said sequences as broken rodlike chains whose
effective lengths increase with temperature-dependent polyproline-
II helical propensities and intrachain electrostatic repulsion that
varies with solvent-system properties (cf. wormlike chains whose
persistence lengths increase with said propensities and invariant
net sequence charge magnitude for HAPTIC2), such that strength
of paratope-epitope contact interactions also varies with said prop-
erties (cf. fixed energetic contributions per residue for HAPTIC2).
HEPTAD2 (like HEPTAD) analyzes sequences that each comprise
a disulfide-bonded cysteine-residue pair. SETH estimates solvent-
system parameter values for HAPTIC3 and HEPTAD2. HUT2 is
freely accessible online (https://freeshell.de/badong/hut2.htm).

Figure 1: HAPTIC3- and HEPTAD2-predicted most immuno-
dominant epitopes among peptidic immunogen sequences
(A-O) that each contain exactly two cysteine residues,
which are assumed to form a disulfide-bonded pair for
HEPTAD2 predictions only. Immune Epitope Database ID
numbers <X> enable record access via URLs of the form
https://www.iedb.org/epitope/<X>. All immunogen residues,
even HIP2-tagged ones (in lowercase) that form putative
hydrophobic blobs (e.g., in A), ordered regions (e.g., in F)
and collapse-/aggregation-prone segments (in B and E), were
used for generating HAPTIC3 and HEPTAD2 predictions.
Epitope residues predicted by HAPTIC3 only, by HEPTAD2
only and by both tools are marked with solid, dotted or
dashed underlines, respectively. Dotted crosshair lines are at
predicted in-vivo antibody affinity ceiling (4.75 ×1011M−1).
