ABSTRACT
With the exponential growth of video data on the World
Wide Web comes the challenge of ecient methods in video
content management, content-based video search, ltering
and browsing. But, video data often lacks sucient meta-
data to open up the video content and to enable pinpoint
content-based search. With the advent of the 'web of data'
as an extension of the current WWW new data sources can
be exploited by semantically interconnecting video meta-
data with the web of data. Thus, enabling better access to
video repositories by deploying semantic search technologies
and improving the user's search experience by supporting
exploratory search strategies. We have developed the pro-
totype semantic video search engine 'yovisto' that demon-
strates the advantages of semantically enhanced exploratory
video search and enables investigative navigation and brows-
ing in large video repositories.

1. INTRODUCTION
The popularity of video and multimedia data has become
a driving force for growth in the World Wide Web (WWW).
Portal sites such as, e. g., YouTube1and other content ag-
gregators provide billions of video resources. While con-
tent management systems already are able to maintain large
video repositories, search and pinpoint access of video con-
tent is left over to the user. Textual metadata enable content-
based retrieval of video resources. But, for the most part,

.textual metadata originate from manual annotation carried
out by authors or expert users. Automated video analysis
techniques mostly provide low-level descriptions with su-
cient accuracy, but the subsequent aggregation of dierent
low-level features to derive high-level features concerning the
contents is error-prone and algorithmic expensive. With the
advent of Web 2.0 also user generated textual metadata such
as, e. g., user tags or comments complement the authorita-
tive manual annotation. Nevertheless, insucient textual
metadata is responsible for poor search performance.
Today, Google2has become synonymous for web search.
The user enters a query string that might consist out of one
or several keywords and Google's web search engine delivers
(text) documents containing these keywords or multimedia
documents annotated with metadata containing these key-
words. In the majority of cases this approach is absolutely
sucient. But, users might have dierent information needs
and dierent ways to search for information. If the search
task is getting more complex, i. e. if a single document is
not the answer to the user's search problem, dierent search
strategies have to be applied. Moreover, if the user tries
to get an overview of available information about a certain
topic, today's web search engines often are ooding search
results by millions. Thus, giving the user no chance to re-
view but the rst few resulting pages.
Sometimes, users are looking for a specic set of docu-
ments that do contain almost all the keywords of the query
string (navigational searches), while in many other cases the
user tries to gather information about a specic subject with
no particular document in mind (research searches) [12]. In
complex search tasks, the user rst has to retrieve some facts
(i. e. documents containing those facts), which are required
to enable further search queries to solve the overall search
problem. Often, the user is not familiar with the topic she is
searching for, and sometimes, the user isn't sure about her
search goal in the rst place. This kind of search is known
as 'exploratory search' [17]. In this paper, we address the
problem of how to deploy exploratory search for video data
by using semantic search technology.
In the Semantic Web as being an evolving extension of the
WWW the meaning of information and services is well de-
ned. Linked Data has become one of the most popular top-
ics among the emerging Semantic Web [2]. By Linked Data
we refer to a method of exposing, sharing, and connecting
data via dereferenceable URI on the WWW. The Linking
2http://www.google.com/Open Data (LOD) project aims at making semantic data
freely available to everyone and provides starting points to
extract relationships among information resources.
By mapping available video metadata to Linked Data, we
show how to utilize cross-connections and data interdepen-
dencies to enable new ways of search space visualization and
navigation. One of the key interlinking hubs of the LOD
cloud is DBpedia3, the semantic counterpart of the online
encyclopedia Wikipedia [1]. But, DBpedia often provides
too many facts and details about entities. Thus, sophisti-
cated heuristics have to be applied to achieve a ranking to
identify the most important, i. e. interesting facts for a given
entity [28].
Contrariwise to facetted search approaches, which aim
to further rene an original search query by clustering the
search results according to common properties, exploratory
search broadens the scope of the search query by suggest-
ing associated terms, concepts, and resources. These ex-
ploratory search suggestions can be used to navigate among
the entire search space and to explore the repository content
by user guided browsing [27]. Thus, enabling the possibility
to achieve search results that the user wasn't looking for in
the rst place by serendipity.
The major contributions of this paper are the following:
We have developed a frequency-based heuristics for ranking
entity properties and relationships of LOD resources includ-
ing ecient oine indexing for semantic video search. The
most relevant properties are applied for the generation of
contentually related search suggestions, and the quality of
the overall exploratory search approach is shown with ap-
propriate evaluation methods.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents re-
lated work and introduces to exploratory search, the yovisto
semantic video search, and the general problem of evaluating
exploratory search systems. Section 3 details, how Linked
Data facilitates exploratory semantic search. In Section 4,
our evaluation method for exploratory video search is pre-
sented together with rst qualitative evaluation results. The
last section concludes the paper with a brief outlook on fu-
ture work.
2. RELATED WORK
This section covers research related to the work presented
in this paper. This includes various approaches of seman-
tic and exploratory search emphasizing the focus on video
search in general and the yovisto academic video search plat-
form in particular, including evaluation.
According to Guha et al. 'Semantic Search is the appli-
cation of the Semantic Web to search' [12]. Correspond-
ingly, Semantic Web resources and technologies are applied
to augment the traditional search scenario. In the Semantic
Web as being an extension of the current WWW informa-
tion is complemented by formal knowledge representations
with well dened meaning [3]. Linked Open Data has be-
come one of the most popular topics among the emerging
Semantic Web [4]. It supports the Semantic Web vision by
leveraging free access to interconnected semantic data. In
this paper we present a semantically enhanced exploratory
search based on LOD resources, in particular on DBpedia,
which contains structured information from the popular on-
line encyclopedia Wikipedia [1]. A comprehensive survey
3http://www.dbpedia.org/on dierent approaches to Semantic Search is given in [16],
while in [26] a formal model of ontology-based Information
Retrieval in general is presented.
There are two main challenges for Semantic Search [12]:
(1) the query input has to be mapped to concepts and enti-
ties [14, 18] and (2) the search domain has to be augmented
with semantic content [9]. We address both challenges in
this paper.
Alternatively, Semantic Search is often referred to as re-
trieval of data from the Semantic Web, as being represented
by semantic search engines such as Sindice [20]. The work in
this paper does not relate to this interpretation of Semantic
Search.
Exploratory search assists in exploring the data space by
providing data visualization, related content, a wide range of
sophisticated selection options, and various possibilities for
analysis. In order to allow a multi-facetted, multi-tactical,
opportunistic, and open ended search, exploratory search is
targeting learning and investigation tasks [17, 29]. To enable
this complex and investigative retrieval option, underlying
metadata including implicit and formerly unknown relation-
ships among resources need to be fully made accessible. We
extend and complement previous work on this topic by ap-
plying improved exploratory search to video data on the
WWW and by framing suitable evaluation procedures for
exploratory search [27, 28]. A motivation to use exploratory
search over traditional search methods is given in [17].
State of the art video retrieval systems use a combina-
tion of visual and textual feature extraction for search in-
dex generation and combine these techniques with machine
learning procedures [25, 11, 8]. However, the chosen feature
extraction depends on domain and task characteristics and
determines the quality of the retrieval system.
Yovisto is a video search engine specialized on video record-
ings of academic lectures and conference talks [22, 13, 27].
To enable pinpoint search access within the video recordings
a combination of automated video analysis and user gen-
erated collaborative annotation is deployed in connection
with ne granular, time-dependent metadata. We extend
the search capabilities of yovisto by adding an exploratory
search feature that enables the user to browse the content of
the underlying video repository in a multi-facetted way. In
dierence to popular recommender systems, our approach is
neither based on logle analysis and statistical usage anal-
ysis of content popularity, nor on similarity-based methods
such as query by example [15, 10, 5].
Evaluation of traditional information retrieval systems is
based on rather quantitative than qualitative measurements
of the achieved retrieval results. The retrieval results are
compared to a ground truth resulting in an objective as-
sessment of the achieved quality, i. e. by statistical classi-
cations such as recall and precision. Evaluation strategies
from the well known TrecVid benchmarks fall into this cat-
egory. Their focus lies on pure system evaluation. Evalua-
tion based on direct user involvement, referred to as 'User
evaluation' is explicitly mentioned as out of scope for these
benchmarks [24].
To demonstrate the added value of newly implemented
retrieval features it is suitable to execute the same evalu-
ation task with and without application of the specic re-
trieval feature. The dierences between the resulting mea-
surements mark the eect of the new retrieval feature. Singh
et al. apply this evaluation strategy in [23]. We adopt thisapproach for our evaluation to demonstrate the usefulness
of exploratory search in yovisto. The motivation to use this
strategy lies in the subjective and investigative nature of ex-
ploratory search [17], which makes it dicult to determine
an objective ground truth for reference. Therefore, we ap-
ply additional qualitative evaluation measures by monitor-
ing user satisfaction throughout the work task, as proposed
in [21].
In [7] a framework for evaluation of interactive informa-
tion retrieval systems is presented where the user task is
formulated in a cover story leading to the work task and
nally to the actual search task. Two evaluation strategies
are compared, which distinguish multiple types of relevance,
inter alia, so-called 'Situational Relevance', which reects
the dynamic nature of relevance [6]. Situational relevance
also applies to exploratory search scenarios, where the user's
relevance scale may be inuenced by the receipt of new in-
formation.
3. IMPLEMENTING SEMANTIC EXPLO-
RATORY SEARCH
This section presents the process of the exploratory se-
mantic search and its implementation in the video search
engine yovisto. In addition, a novel frequency-based heuris-
tic for ranking entity properties and relationships of LOD
is described complementing previous work [28]. In addi-
tion, a prototype graphical user interface (GUI) to deploy
exploratory search is presented.
3.1 Exploratory Search Workﬂow
Exploratory search aims to broaden the scope of search
by suggesting related terms, concepts and resources. Our
approach uses LOD resources to support the search process
by exposing additional information about indexed resources
in yovisto, which are semantically interrelated to the users
search query. For example, if someone is looking for video
information about 'barack obama' an additional navigation
component shows supplementary and associated informa-
tion resources about president Barack Obama also being
available in the repository in addition to the direct search
results (cf. sect. 3.5). This supplementary information in-
cludes, as e. g., related places (birth place, work place, etc),
predecessor and successor in the presidential oce, or his
alma mater. Almost any DBpedia information can be made
available as supplementary information to propose ancillary
search possibilities to the user. But, there is too much infor-
mation available in DBpedia to be displayed to the user in
total. Therefore, the most important of all related resources
have to be determined.
To enable this functionality a three-part approach is ap-
plied: (1) the user query is mapped to one or more DBpedia
entities, (2) for each entity the best matching associated en-
tities are determined, and (3) it is checked, which of the
associated concepts are even available in the yovisto reposi-
tory.
The best matching associated entities are determined based
on predened heuristics as described in [28]. Statistical mea-
surements like property frequency or vice-versa property re-
latedness are taken into account to rank the associated enti-
ties. Fig. 1 depicts the overall workow of exploratory search
in yovisto including its particular components. The pro-
cess is based on two main information sources, the yovistoSynonym Type

search index andDBpedia . The yovisto search index is gener-
ated from automated, manual and collaboratively generated
metadata for more than 8.000 videos [13, 22] and it contains
more than 2 million terms. DBpedia provides interopera-
ble RDF structured data about 2.9 million 'things' with 479
million 'facts'4for dierent domains.
Within the workow a gazetteer dictionary and a related
entities list are generated form the original data sources and
stored in a database. The processing of this intermediate
data is very computing-intensive. Therefore, computation
is performed oine to maintain fast query responses. The
online search process comprises entity mapping of the query
string and exploratory search suggestions . While entity map-
ping connects the query string to DBpedia entities, the ex-
ploratory search suggestion proposes the most relevant as-
sociated resources available in the yovisto index to the user.
The following sections encompass the workow stages in de-
tail.
3.2 Mapping Queries to Entities
The user query component propagates the query string
qto the yovisto search index to compute the direct search
results and to a gazetteer lookup component, which maps
the query string qto a list of DBpedia entities furi ig. The
gazetteer is a named-entity list created by synset genera-
tion. The gazetteer comprises a list of synonyms (synset)
fsigfor every entity in DBpedia represented by its URI.
Hence, the gazetteer is dened as set of (synset, URI)-tuples:
f(fs ig; uri j)g.
To create the synset for an entity, dierent sources in
DBpedia have to be utilized. The most reliable DBpedia
source for entity mapping is the DBpedia URI-sux. The
URI-sux denotes the string, which remains after remov-
ing the prex ' http://dbpedia.org/resource/' from the
URI and replacing underscores ' ' by single whitespaces.
In the majority of cases, the URI-sux denotes the en-
tity most suitably. Additionally, literals of the DBpedia
property rdf:label are eligible, if they dier from the URI-
sux. Table 1 shows synonyms determined for a given en-
tity. In many cases rdf:label also provides labels in dierent
languages, but in some cases, there is no rdf:label provided
at all. Furthermore, so-called 'DBpedia redirects' are an ad-
ditional source for synonyms. A redirect occurs, if a widely
accepted dierent spelling or a common misspelling for the
resource does exist. Redirects are identied by the DB-
pedia property 'http://dbpedia.org/property/redirect'.
Finally, the URI-sux or labels of a redirect object are taken
into account for synonyms.

sets for more than 3.1 million dierent URIs. The gazetteer
lookup maps the query string within the synsets and returns
the matching entities furi ig. For every entity in this list,
therelated entity selection determines associated entities,
which are nally suggested to the user, to carry on with the
exploratory search. The structure of the related entities list
and its generation is discussed in the following section.
3.3 Find Associated Entities
Related entities are determined by the application of a
heuristic based ranking for the associated entities of a given
entity. The component related entities generation is respon-
sible for applying various heuristics to all 3.1 million entities
in DBpedia and to lter out low ranked, i. e. not important
associated entities. For a given entity a related resource is
initially dened as:
r= (uri;fsig; l; p; pl; rank )
with urithe URI of the related entity, fsigthe synset for
the URI, la label to display to the user, pthe property
the entity is connected with the related entity, pla property
label for display, and rank the ranking within all related
resources of the entity.
In addition to the basic ltering heuristics already pre-
sented in [28] we have developed an improved frequency-
based heuristic. This heuristic is based on the assumption
that the more often a property occurs on instances of a spe-
cic category or type, the more relevant is it. As input for
this heuristic the frequency of RDF properties used in con-
junction with concepts of a specic RDF type (rdf:type) or
SKOS5category (skos:subject) in DBpedia are taken into
account. Table 2 shows the frequencies of various properties
for all entities with skos:subject Category:Presidents ofthe-
United States. For exploratory search we suggest only re-
lated entities connected to the high frequent, i. e. most im-
portant properties. If a resource belongs to more than one

skos:subjects, the frequencies of each property are added up.
Furthermore, we have to ensure that only resources are
suggested to the user that are also available in the yovisto
index.
3.4 Mapping Index Data to Entities
To determine if resources for particular DBpedia entities
are also available in the yovisto search index, an index re-
quest consisting of the related entity synset is generated.
For this query all synonyms are interlinked with boolean
OR. This ensures the completeness of the result list, conse-
quentially increasing recall, but in some cases at the expense
of precision. This index request returns the number of re-
sults for a direct search based on the entity synset, which is
additionally stored in the gazetteer list and subsequently in
the related resources. Finally, the related entities list con-
tains only entities that are also present in the yovisto search
index. Hence, the related entity list is dened as: f(uri i:
fr1; :::; r mg)gwith rj= (uri j;fsig; l; p; pl; rank; freq ) with
freq > 0.
Related entities to the original user query are displayedFigure 2: The exploratory search GUI showing related entities for 'american president'.
within a navigation window and the user is free to choose
one of the recommended search suggestions. By clicking
on one of the related resources a new user query is issued.
At this stage the entity mapping can be omitted, because
the URI for the query is already known. The synset of the
selected suggestion is used to retrieve the new search results
from the yovisto index.
3.5 The User Interface for Exploratory Search
We have designed the user interface for exploratory search
to consist out of three main areas: the direct search results
in the center including geographical information displayed
in a map on top of the search results, the facet lter on
the right, and the exploratory search navigation on the left
(cf. Fig. 2). In the direct search results a timeline exposes
the automatically generated temporal segmentation of the
videos with highlighted segments that are relevant according
to the current query string. The facet lter allows to nar-
row the search results according to the type of resource, the
scientic category, the issuing organization of the video, the
language of the video, as well as popular user tags attached
to the video segments.
The exploratory search navigation is designed with a sim-
ple vertical layout to be displayed on the left to the direct
search results. The exploratory navigation reects the ex-
ploratory search workow. When the user enters a query
string, the labels of the mapped entities (1) are shown dis-
tinctly below the search input eld followed by all related
entities (2) grouped by their connecting properties (3). Nextto the related entity labels a number in brackets denotes how
many video resources for this particular entity exist in the
yovisto video repository.
Fig. 2 depicts the result of a query for 'american presi-
dent' that is mapped to the DBpedia entity 'President of the
United States'. The exploratory search GUI suggests a list of
related entities. By clicking on, e. g. ' Barack Obama ', a new
search is issued and the exploratory search GUI switches to
the newly selected entity with its related entities and prop-
erties (cf. Fig. 3). To retain previous actions, a list (4)
provides links, which allow to jump back in search history.
Optionally, the user may activate a preview of the search
results being evoked by a related entity, when clicking on it
(5). Moving the mouse pointer over these previews causes
a popup to show brief information about the video resource
(6).
Some DBpedia properties such as 'predecessor' (7, 8) have
the characteristic trait to connect entities of the same type.
They allow to move 'hand over hand' from one entity of
a distinct category to the next. This enables the user to
quickly exploit the information of individual entities.
A prototype implementation of the GUI is available at:
http://testing.yovisto.com/.
4. EV ALUATION
In this section an evaluation method for exploratory search
scenarios is presented including the discussion of rst results.
While evaluation of traditional information retrieval systemsFigure 3: The exploratory search GUI showing re-
lated entities for 'Barack Obama' and 'George W.
Bush'.
focus on quantitative measures for the quality of retrieval re-
sults, the evaluation of exploratory search strongly depends
on qualitative measurements. Concerning the denition of
exploratory search, the user does not always exactly know
what documents she is looking for. This stems because the
user may be not familiar with the search topic, maybe she
does not know where to begin and where to end the search,
as well as she might not be sure about the search goal in the
rst place. Thus, it is rather dicult to dene an objective
ground truth for given exploratory search tasks, because in-
dividual search strategies, motivations, and interests cause
ground truth also to depend on the eye of the beholder.
Therefore, quantitative evaluation measures such as pre-
cision and recall are less signicant for exploratory search
tasks than qualitative measurements, such as e. g., user sat-
isfaction with the achieved search results and user experi-
ence during the search process.
We have made up 9 dierent search scenario tasks to be
solved by test users. For exploratory search, the tasks have
to be formulated in a way that there is most likely no di-
rect answer possible. Moreover, the tasks must involve an
iterative search strategy, where the answers being achieved
in the rst step are applied as input to the second search
step, etc. E. g., instead of asking 'nd videos about Barack
Obama' we asked the user to retrieve videos about all US
presidents. Thereby, in the rst place, the user has to nd1. Which other scientists did Albert Einstein know per-
sonally in the 1920s and on which event he might got
to know them?
2. Which philosophers build on the theories of the greek
philosopher Plato?
3. Find videos with information about the German chan-
cellors from 1949 until today.
4. Find videos about celestial bodies of the solar system.
5. Find videos about lm directors.
6. Which videos contain information about US federal
states?
7. Find videos about the founders and main promotors
of the Enlightenment movement.
8. Find videos about cities of the Hanseatic League.

out the names of the former US presidents before retrieving
videos about them. To compare exploratory video search
with traditional video search, we presented the same search
tasks to users and asked one subset of users to solve the
tasks with the exploratory search feature, while the rest had
to solve the task without the exploratory search feature, i. e.
without the exploratory search sidebar activated in the GUI.
Of course we rst had to gure out which task topics were
really suited for the yovisto video repository. The resulting
evaluation tasks are listed in table 3. For the evaluation we
did not limit the time required for each single task, but left it
to the user to decide when to nish. Not all tasks were pro-
cessed by every test person. While working on the retrieval
tasks the test persons were asked after every partial search
step, if it is still be possible to achieve the search objective
in this search session, to gather information about the mo-
tivation of the test person. The evaluation interface also
provides the possibility to select and mark relevant videos
among the retrieval results according to the test person's
opinion. The decision, if a video in the retrieval result is rel-
evant or not can be made based on investigating the search
results, which comprises surrogates of the videos such as im-
age previews, preview text, user tags, comments, the video
timeline, as well as reviewing the video itself. After nish-
ing the search task, the user was instructed to review the
selected videos again and to decide of the selection was ap-
propriate. Finally, after nishing each task the user was
asked, if she had achieved the search goal, how satised she
felt with the achieved result, how helpful the search func-
tionality was in general, and how familiar she is with the
domain of the search task. Satisfaction, helpfulness, and
familiarity were measured on scale from 0 (not at all) to 4
(very much).
Table 4 shows the results of the evaluation with respect to
the tests with exploratory search (2nd column) and the con-
trol group tests without exploratory search (3rd column). A
total number of 19 persons were participating the tests, 13

group accomplishes only 27.7 % of tasks successfully. While
processing the queries, in 97.8 % of queries the participants
felt, that it is possible to achieve the search objective. The
control group was just with 82.2 % of the queries motivated.
On scale from 0 to 4, with exploratory search the satis-
faction was evaluated to 1.99 in average. The control group
was only satised with 1.01 in average. The helpfulness
was assessed with 2.37 with exploratory search, whereas the
control group has only assessed 1.60. The familiarity was
measured to 1.10 with exploratory search and 0.89 with-
out. The average task processing time is observed with 6.2
minutes using exploratory search and 6.8 minutes without
exploratory search. Finally, 2.61 videos per task were con-
sidered to be relevant with exploratory search, whereas 2.06
videos per task were selected without exploratory search.
Table 4 shows also the standard deviations for the particu-
lar results.
Summarizing the results, the number of tasks accomplished
successfully was doubled up to 54.3 % by use of the ex-
ploratory search. The motivation of participants was sig-
nicantly higher with the exploratory search feature. Sat-
isfaction was increased by 20 %, helpfulness was increased
by 15 %. Familiarity and processing time were improved by
use with exploratory search, but not very much. In general,
exploratory search leads to more selected videos. A detailed
overview on the presented and further evaluation results can
be found at: http://www.yovisto.com/evaluation/.
Our results reect the usability of the GUI and the user's
satisfaction with the quality of the achieved results. A re-
nement of the evaluation could be achieved by focusing on
these two aspects separately. Furthermore, the heuristics-
based recommendation of related entities to a given user
query is an integral part of the exploratory search. These
heuristics are depending on local repository data and on
LOD resources from DBpedia. Thus, an evaluation of these
heuristics independently of the achieved results could be
conducted to measure the impact of recommendations in-
dependently form the usability of the GUI.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we addressed the problem of how to deploy
exploratory search for video data by using semantic searchtechnology and demonstrated an improved exploratory search
for the yovisto video search engine along with an evaluation
of the exploratory search process. Exploratory search is sup-
ported by heuristics based on semantic data from the LOD
resources, which are used to augment direct search result
with navigational information that might be also relevant
for the user. We presented a new frequency-based heuristic
for determining related information resources and evaluated
the exploratory search feature by using a comparative eval-
uation technique. Thus, we were able to objectively point
out the positive aspects of the exploratory search approach
such as a higher task accomplishment, higher motivation
and satisfaction rates.
Exploratory search is at it's early stages as a research area.
Currently, there does not exist an overall accepted best-
practice neither on how to realize nor on how to evaluate
exploratory search. We aimed to overcome this shortcom-
ing by strongly relating our accomplishments and methods
to existing research in this area.
Since the heuristics for the determination of 'interesting'
relationships among data entities play a major role in the
exploratory search approach, we are developing objective
evaluation procedures for the optimization of these heuris-
tics. In addition, improvements of the graphical user inter-
face explicitly supporting the investigative and navigational
aspect of our approach will be considered in future work.
For better support in data space navigation, future work
is focussed on the combination of facetted and explorative
search features to satisfy the searchers curiosity and to foster
serendipitous discovery.
