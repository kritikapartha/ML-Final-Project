ABSTRACT
There is little research on why underrepresented minorities are less
likely to specifically study Machine Learning and Artificial Intel-
ligence (ML/AI). We surveyed 159 undergraduate students about
their interest in, exposure to, and personal views on ML/AI in or-
der to explore variations in responses by self-reported gender and
race/ethnicity groups. We found that students underrepresented by
race/ethnicity are∼6 times less likely to take a traditional ML/AI
course than those not underrepresented by race/ethnicity, but no
significant difference was found between gender representation.
Additionally, students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are more
likely to report interest in social, cultural, and political impacts
of ML/AI rather than the more technical aspects of ML/AI itself,
which is a prevalent interest of students not underrepresented by
race/ethnicity. We explore potential reasoning for this difference
through further analysis of their survey responses. Encouragingly,
we find that regardless of representational status 72.0% of students
who report lack of interest in a traditional introductory course are
interested in a ML/AI course that focuses more on the political,
philosophical, and ethical issues raised by ML/AI and its impacts
on society. Our findings suggest that a “CS Principles” style intro-
ductory ML/AI course, emphasizing social and political impacts,
could be an effective way to promote diversity in ML/AI.

1 INTRODUCTION
The field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI)
has tremendous potential to reshape almost every aspect of society,
even beyond its already-significant impact. It is also a field that is
overwhelmingly dominated by men and that suffers from a widely-
acknowledged “whiteness problem. ” [ 7,12]. Until and unless ML/AI
has a diverse range of researchers and practitioners, the field will
continue to cause harm to the most vulnerable and to exacerbate
existing inequalities [12, 13, 25].
Computing education has made some progress toward improving
diversity. Efforts utilizing the communal goal congruity perspective
have successfully increased gender and racial/ethnic diversity in cer-
tain domains [ 5], particularly through "CS Principles" style courses
that employ strategies consistent with this approach [ 2,24,30]. In
an effort to effect similar changes on the field of ML/AI in particular,
recent contributions have advocated for earlier exposure of ML/AI
topics [ 20,27] and for enabling participants to utilize their own
personal data [ 22]. But these efforts do not consider the underlying
causes for this unequal interest, and the reasons why underrepre-
sented students are less likely to study ML/AI still remain unclear.
In order to understand the causes of the disparity, we set out to
determine whether underrepresented students are interested in tak-
ing a traditional introductory ML/AI course, and why. We surveyed
159 students in a North American R1 institution about their likeli-
hood of taking a traditional introductory ML/AI course and their
experiences and interests in ML/AI. We found that students under-
represented by gender did not differ from their peers in self-reported
likelihood to take such a course, but that students underrepresented
by race/ethnicity did express a lower self-reported likelihood com-
pared to their peers. Given this result, and the lack of substantial
prior work focused on promoting race/ethnicity diversity in ML/AI,
we narrowed our further analysis of survey responses to explore
race/ethnicity differences alone. Although students underrepre-
sented by race/ethnicity are interested in ML/AI, they primarily

report reflecting on the political, philosophical, and ethical implica-
tions of AI, rather than technical implementation. This difference in
interest could be accounted for by the different occasions in which
they encounter ML/AI, or conversely, the difference in occasions
could be due to differing interests. We discuss how attending to
these differences could be used to promote racial/ethnic diversity
in ML/AI, motivating a new introductory ML/AI curriculum to be
designed in future work.
2 RELATED WORK
In general computing education, many scholars utilize self-efficacy
theory to explain differing achievement levels among diverse groups,
with most research centered on gender differences [ 11,14,18,21].
But self-efficacy theory does little to account for disparities of race
and ethnicity, suggesting that bolstering the self-efficacy of racially
and ethnically underrepresented students is unlikely to close ex-
isting gaps of that kind. By contrast, interventions in computing
education designed to leverage the communal goal congruity per-
spective, namely "working with, and in the service of, others", have
been found to drastically increase both gender and racial diversity
[5]. Such interventions may include designing course projects to
emphasize the real-world impact of computing professionals.
Various "CS Principles" style courses have employed communal
goal congruity strategies and successfully engaged a more diverse
group of students. Similar to programs highlighted by Brinkman and
Diekman [ 5], these courses are designed to emphasize broader real-
world impacts of computing rather than programming and technical
exercises [ 10,16,19,29]. For instance, the high school Advanced
Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles has been found to
engage a more diverse group of students than the programming-
focused AP Computer Science A course, and often serves as a
point of entry into higher-level STEM education for many female,
Hispanic, Black, and first-generation students [ 2,24,30]. Moreover,
students taking a CS-Principles-style course, Exploring Computer
Science, were over ∼3 times more likely to pass AP Computer
Science A than students who did not take the course in advance
[4]. While the benefits of participation in these courses may be
partially attributed to prior computing experience alone [ 23,26],
it has been shown that directly incorporating content related to
students’ personal interests into CS1 has been shown to increase
pass rates, satisfaction, and attitudes among students from diverse
educational backgrounds [ 9,17], and teaching societal implications
may increase involvement of upper-year CS students [8].
A few previous efforts have been made to modify ML/AI ed-
ucation in order to promote diversity in the field. SAILORS, an
AI-focused summer camp which was designed to promote gender
diversity in ML/AI, encourages high school students to actively
contextualize modern ML/AI technical concepts through social im-
pact [ 27]. The strategy of teaching ML/AI in real-world contextshas been tested in an undergraduate setting as well, where it was
found that students taught machine learning concepts using their
own personal data tend to provide arguments more grounded in
model mechanics during self-advocacy tasks [ 22]. Additionally, in-
troducing ML/AI topics through example applications in earlier
computing curriculum, such as in an introductory Data Science
course, has been used to try to broaden the audience of ML/AI by
motivating interest through exposure [ 20]. However, little attention
has been paid to exploring factors which inhibit diversity in ML/AI
specifically. Thus, our contribution in this work is to explore why
underrepresented students are more less likely to pursue education
in ML/AI, and to investigate the possibility of promoting diversity
through a "ML/AI Principles" course that emphasizes the communal
goal congruity perspective.
3 METHODS
In this section, we explain our data collection and data analysis
processes for exploring our research questions listed below.
•RQ1: Why are underrepresented students less likely to be
in the field of ML/AI?
•RQ2: Are previous exposure to and view of ML/AI related
to interest in studying ML/AI?
•RQ3: Do underrepresented students have interest in ML/AI
at all? If yes, what and how do they want to learn about it?
Note that at the institution, introductory AI is taught as a ML
course. Since most discussion amongst non-specialists in our con-
text is interchangeable, we used the term "ML/AI" for this study
and paper.
3.1 Data Collection
Participants. We recruited 159 undergraduate students from a
North American R1 institution by asking for volunteers to take
a survey through various general email lists, upon the approval
from the Institutional Research Board. We encouraged participation
by offering gift card compensation. As seen in Table 1 the survey
respondents were well-spread across various majors and class years.
Survey. Table 2 lists the survey questions related to ML/AI. Ques-
tions covered student interest in the traditional introductory ML/AI
course on campus, student interest in ML/AI careers and perceived
effects of ML/AI on other fields, previous exposure to ML/AI and CS,
views of ML/AI, and specific student learning interests in ML/AI.
There were 3 5-Point Likert Scale questions, and 12 open-ended
questions. The open-ended questions were used to further under-
stand differences in the responses to the Likert Scale questions. The
survey also collected demographic information such as class year,
gender, race/ethnicity, and intended major.
Certain questions were only asked of those who selected Very
Likely or Likely to course-likelihood, indicating their likelihood of
participation in an existing introductory ML/AI course. These stu-
dents are defined as Likely Students. We note that Likely Students
also include 8 students who said they have already taken or are
currently taking such course. The remaining students are defined
as Not Likely Students. The last two columns of Table 2 indicate the
questions asked of each student group. Responses to course-enjoy
andcourse-not-enjoy were used to further understand how Likely
Students feel about a traditional introductory ML/AI course. This

was based on our assumption that Not Likely Students would not
pursue a ML/AI career. This assumption appears mostly correct
based on responses to career-effects as only 2/107 of Not Likely
Students mentioned interest in pursuing a ML/AI career while 16/52
of Likely Students did. On the other hand, only Not Likely Students
were asked about their interest in an alternative, principles-type
introductory ML/AI course to see if such a course would interest
those who are not likely to take the traditional course.
3.2 Data Analysis
Defining Underrepresented Minorities. We defined underrep-
resented minorities by both gender and race/ethnicity. For gen-
der, underrepresented students (URMs-G) were those who self-
identified as female or non-binary, and not underrepresented stu-
dents (Non-URMs-G) were those who self-identified as male. For
race/ethnicity, underrepresented students (URMs-RE) were those
who self-identified as any of the following: Hispanic or Latinx; Na-
tive Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Black or African American,
and not underrepresented students (Non-URMs-RE) were those
who did not self-identify as any of those categories. Our respon-
dents included 99 URMs-G (62.3%) and 29 URMs-RE (18.2%). We
note that despite its small representation, URMs-RE still included a
variety of majors: 16 STEM, 12 Non-STEM, and 1 Undecided.Analyzing Survey Questions. The Likert Scale questions were
analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests [ 1] to identify statistically sig-
nificant differences between the responses of URMs and Non-URMs.
For the open-ended questions, we used the open-coding ap-
proach [ 15]. The tags that resulted are listed in Table 3. Two authors
of the paper ran inter-rater reliability analysis with for tags that
needed subjective judgements. Specifically for exposure-knowledge
andlearning-interest, we differentiated levels of technical knowl-
edge in ML/AI into None, Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced. Ba-
sics of ML/AI included basic terminology and ideas; an Intermediate
level indicated some level of technical or implementation-based in-
formation; and an Advanced level indicated knowledge of advanced
topics or significant knowledge in particular sub-fields or applica-
tions. We also had the External Factors tag, which indicated ML/AI
outside of technicalities with a focus on societal implications. This
includes media, ethics, privacy, politics, and economics. While the
External Factors tag is not used for course-enjoy, course-not-enjoy,
career-enjoy, and career-not-enjoy, external factors are discussed
through more specific tags and responses to those questions. After a
few iterations of independently tagging the responses and refining
the tagging rubric, we achieved 93% agreement.
The comparisons of the open-ended questions between URMs
and Non-URMs were made by analyzing the percentages of students

in a given student group for which each tag occurred. We used chi-
square tests on occurrences of tags to determine if there was a
statistically significant difference between groups. We note that we
could not run tests on 15/70 tags as they had zero occurrences for
URMs. We also note that our findings on course-enjoy, course-not-
enjoy, career-enjoy, career-not-enjoy, and career-effects rely on
anecdotal evidence since there were only two URMs-RE in Likely
Students.
Focus on Race/Ethnicity. We began the analysis with course-
likelihood based on our assumption that taking a traditional intro-
ductory ML/AI course is a first step to enter the field. The results
showed that there is no significant difference in responses between
URMs-G and Non-URMs-G while there is between URMs-RE and
Non-URMs-RE. Thus, the rest of the analysis focused on comparing
URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE. This will be discussed in Section 4.1.
4 RESULTS
4.1 RQ1: Interest in being in the field of ML/AI
Interest in a Traditional Introductory ML/AI Course. Out of
all the student respondents, 32.7% selected Likely or Very Likely to
course-likelihood. There was no statistically significant difference
in the likelihood of taking a traditional introductory ML/AI course
between URMs-G and Non-URMs-G ( 𝑝=0.22). On the contrary,
there was a statistically significant difference between URMs-RE
and Non-URMs-RE (6.9% v 38.5%, 𝑝<0.001). Notably, only 2 out
of 29 URMs-RE responded Likely or Very Likely. This trend was
consistent when analyzing course-likelihood-reasoning in that In-
terest in Content was the only tag with a statistically significantdifference between URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE ( 𝑝<0.01). This
is notable in that there was no other direct reason reported that
would explain the difference in course-likelihood responses.
Moreover, those two URMs-RE in Likely Students appeared
more interested in learning about the external factors of ML/AI
through a traditional introductory ML/AI course rather than learn-
ing about the technicalities of ML/AI. From questions course-enjoy
andcourse-not-enjoy, their responses included: "I would proba-
bly not enjoy learning the technical aspects as much as more sur-
face/societal level information," "I would find it helpful for future
[non-CS STEM field] classes, day to day life, conversations with friends,
and the [non-CS STEM field] job industry. "
Interest in ML/AI Careers. 44.0% of Non-URMs-RE who are also
Likely Students responded Likely or Very Likely to career-likelihood.
However, neither of the two URMs-RE who are also Likely Students
responded so (i.e., Neutral and Unlikely). They elaborated on career-
enjoy andcareer-not-enjoy that they would find the technical aspect
unenjoyable: "I would enjoy working with more societal aspects of AI.
I don’t think I would enjoy AI development," "I hope that my future
career contains AI but I am not confident that I am good enough at
it to be proficient in a strictly AI field." They believed that ML/AI
would affect their careers though, according to the responses to
career-effects: "AI could be an interesting research tool, " "AI is bound
to affect [non-CS STEM major] due to the technologies we have to
utilize." This contrasted with their counterparts’ in that 5 (10.0%)
Non-URMs-RE who are also Likely Students found the technical
projects enjoyable from career-enjoy.

4.2 RQ2: Prior Exposure and View of ML/AI
Figure 1 describes the exposure-experience tags of URMs-RE and
Non-URMs-RE. According to the Specific ML/AI Experience tag,
none of URMs-RE reported that they have specific ML/AI experi-
ence, while more than 10% of Non-URMs-RE said they do. URMs-RE
instead tend to have more general computing experience, such as
experience with specific languages or technologies or learning
through CS-Related Courses, which are STEM courses that utilize
CS rather than CS courses themselves. Furthermore, significantly
more Non-URMs-RE appeared to have taken at least one CS course
since University CS Courses was the only tag with a statistically
significant difference ( 𝑝<0.01). Interestingly, all of the 8 URMs-
RE with the tag University CS Courses were not likely to take a
traditional ML/AI course (i.e. Not Likely Students).
The occasions both groups run into ML/AI topics were also dif-
ferent. As seen on Figure 2, Non-URMs-RE were exposed to ML/AI
through Independent Research or Reading statistically significantly
more than their counterparts ( 𝑝=0.02). Despite its statistical in-
significance, URMs-RE in our sample seemed to instead encounter
ML/AI through science fiction. However, both groups’ most com-
mon response was the same, current applications (tagged on 39.0%
of all responses). Sample responses included: "how sites like YouTube
use AI to recommend content to people. It’s surprisingly effective, but
also worrisome that it finds things you didn’t even know you were
looking for," "science fiction portrayals, usually dystopian, but also
in the context of how AI and algorithms function in providing med-
ical care and financial support for healthcare," "home -assisting Al
technologies such as Alexa, Google play, etc. "

Figure 4: Tag Occurrences of learning-interest (*:𝑝<0.05)
Figure 3 describes the exposure-knowledge tags of URMs-RE
and Non-URMs-RE. Basics and External Factors were the tags with
statistically significant differences between URMs-RE and Non-
URMs-RE ( 𝑝=0.02;𝑝<0.01). Additionally, no URMs-RE reported
an Intermediate or Advanced level of knowledge.
Overall, the surveyed Non-URMs-RE take more CS courses, have
specific ML/AI experience, and run into ML/AI through indepen-
dent research or reading. However, even with differences in expo-
sure, views of ML/AI appeared to be the same between Non-URMs-
RE and URMs-RE in our sample, since no tag from view-effects-
past-society andview-effects-future-society showed a statistically
significant difference. General Technical Progress was the majority
for both groups (tagged on 49.1% of all view-effects-past-society
responses and 44.7% of all view-effects-future-society responses).
4.3 RQ3: Learning Interests in ML/AI
Out of all the student respondents who received the question
learning-principles-course-likelihood (i.e. Not Likely Students), 72.0%
selected Interested or Very Interested. There was no statistically sig-
nificant difference in the responses both by gender and race/ethnicity
(𝑝=0.91;𝑝=0.92). This is notable since we saw such a difference
incourse-likelihood responses that showed it was less likely for
URMs-RE to take a traditional introductory ML/AI course than
Non-URMs-RE. URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE are instead both inter-
ested in an introductory ML/AI course focusing on various political,
philosophical, and ethical issues and societal impacts rather than
technical aspects of ML/AI.
Figure 4 describes the learning-interest tags of URMs-RE and
Non-URMs-RE. External Factors was the only tag with a statisti-
cally significant difference between URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE
(𝑝=0.04). A few examples of what URMs-RE wanted to learn are:
"What exactly counts as AI, how has AI been used (e.g. in government
vs. medicine), what are the ethical implications, how costly and time
consuming is the process of creating AI, " "the ethics/politics/philosophy
of AI... [AI] becomes more mainstream and help me judge the prac-
tices of corporations that use AI," "the various public opinions to AI
worldwide. "

4615 DISCUSSION
5.1 Different Interests in ML/AI
According to our results, both URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE are
interested in ML/AI to some degree, but differences were observed
in: (1) the likelihood of taking a traditional introductory course and
pursuing a career in ML/AI, (2) the level of knowledge in ML/AI
they currently have, and (3) what they want to learn about ML/AI.
It appears that lack of interest in existing ML/AI opportunities
could itself be a reason why not many URMs-RE enter the field
(which would account for a lack of interest in both traditional
ML/AI introductory courses and a career in the field). This finding
motivates the question of whether there are identifiable factors that
influence students’ interest. We suspect that the difference in ways
students are exposed to ML/AI could be one such factor. However,
it’s also possible that different routes of exposure to ML/AI could
reflect existing patterns of interest, so future work is required to
investigate how these differences in interests are formed.
We found that Non-URMs-RE reported independent research or
reading as an occasion which caused them to think about ML/AI in
exposure-occasions at a higher rate than URMs-RE. Both groups
reported engagement with science fiction, though URMs-RE did so
at a higher rate. Although this difference is not statistically signifi-
cant, it aligns in intriguing ways with URMs-RE reported interest in
social, philosophical and political dimensions of ML/AI. Although
some works of science fiction do focus closely on the technical
aspects of the advanced technologies of the worlds they describe,
most science fiction forefronts the questions about personhood,
justice, social control and other elements of society and individ-
ual experience which are raised by these technologies. Therefore,
it seems reasonable to infer that students who were provoked to
reflect on ML/AI by science fiction are drawn in or compelled by
those broader non-technical questions, which are typically outside
the purview of a traditional ML/AI course. Such issues are typically
addressed in engineering ethics education, and often sequestered
there away from technical coursework [3, 6].
Despite tendencies of URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE in our sur-
vey to express interests in different aspects of ML/AI, and differing
occasions that prompted them to think about ML/AI, the groups
were quite similar with regard to how frequently they expressed
concern about potential harms (48.3% and 44.6% respectively). Al-
though no question about concern for negative impacts was asked,
the Explicit Worry or Negativity tag applied to 40.4% of responses
even among those students who described themselves as likely to
take a traditional introductory ML/AI course. This percentage was
roughly on par with 47.7% of responses expressing explicit concern
or negativity from students not likely to take an intro course. This
result may suggest that an individual’s negative personal impres-
sions of ML/AI and its impacts on society are not necessarily related
to interest in or intent to enter the field.
5.2 Motivations for Developing "ML/AI
Principles" Curriculum
While, according to our survey responses, URMs-RE were ∼6 times
less likely to take a traditional introductory ML/AI course, there
was no difference between URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE in thelikelihoods of taking a new introductory ML/AI course that focuses
on the political, philosophical, and ethical issues raised by ML/AI
and its impacts on society. Since such content aligns with the appar-
ent interests of URMs-RE, this highlights the potential of a "ML/AI
Principles" curriculum as a means to attract more diverse student
population to the field of ML/AI, even including URMs-RE who
are often not the primary focus of many diversity-related ML/AI
campaigns [ 27,28]. Similar to "CS Principles" courses, we antici-
pate that a "ML/AI Principles" course, which provides foundational
ML/AI exposure and compelling projects oriented towards social
good, will benefit diverse student groups, especially since a pos-
sible explanation for why "CS Principles" courses have success in
increasing diversity is that their attention to real-world impacts or
students’ personal interests elicits engagement from students from
diverse backgrounds [9, 17].
6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
The survey was administered at a single university with voluntary
student participation, and recruitment emails indicated to potential
participants that the survey involved ML/AI. Thus, the participants
may not represent the overall university student population or ex-
ternal populations of students. Although the student composition of
the participants is comparable to the actual student composition on
campus, relatively few URMs-RE (29, 18.2% of respondents) made us
impossible to run statistical tests on some questions. Nevertheless,
the preliminary, anecdotal evidence found through their responses
still provides some exploratory insights on potential hypothesis for
future studies with a larger and more diverse student population.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this study, we explored why underrepresented students are less
likely to be in the field of ML/AI and what could potentially interest
them in studying ML/AI. We found that there is a difference be-
tween the likelihoods of URMs-RE and Non-URMs-RE to take the
traditional introductory ML/AI course, but there is no difference
between the likelihoods of URMs-G and Non-URMs-G. URMs-RE
tend to be more interested in external factors of ML/AI rather than
technical aspects of the subject, which is the focus of many intro-
ductory courses. They are exposed somewhat differently to ML/AI
than Non-URMs-RE, but do not seem to have significantly different
views or feelings about it. This suggests that a course focusing on
external factors of ML/AI could promote racial/ethnic diversity in
the field. To further examine how to best promote racial/ethnic di-
versity in ML/AI, our next steps include to validate the survey based
on existing responses then collect new responses from a larger sam-
ple across multiple universities, likely providing more data from
URMs to further examine what influences student interest in ML/AI.
We can additionally look into detailed differences between URMs-G
and Non-URMs-G and compare the experiences and interests of
URMs-RE and URMs-G. Using our results, we can also now begin to
develop a new introductory ML/AI course curriculum specifically
involving external factors to interest URMs and promote diversity.
