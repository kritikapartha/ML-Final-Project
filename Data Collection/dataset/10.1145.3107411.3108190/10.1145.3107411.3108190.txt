ABSTRACT
B-cell epitope prediction aims to support translational
applications as exempliﬁed by peptide-based vaccine design.
This entails selection of immunizing peptide sequences that
tend to be intrinsically disordered and thus appropriately
described within the framework of polymer theory. A fully
extended hexapeptide sequence spans a typical antibody
footprint; but disordered peptides are ﬂexible rather than
rigid, such that their B-cell epitopes may vary in length
according to the diversity of conformations assumed upon
binding by antibodies. Hence, peptides were modeled herein
as worm-like chains, using an interpolated approximation of
the radial probability density distribution function to
estimate the probability that the ends of a peptidic sequence
are separated by a distance less than or equal to a typical
antibody footprint diameter. The results suggest that the
epitopes are likely to be no more than 17 residues long,
which is consistent with available structural data on immune
complexes consisting of antipeptide antibodies bound to
cognate peptide antigens. For such antigens, B-cell epitope
prediction thus could proceed with initial scanning for
intrinsically disordered sequences of length up to a physico-
chemically plausible maximum value (e.g., 17 residues), with
analysis of progressively longer subsequences to identify
nonredundant sets of putative epitopes (e.g., based on
predicted aﬃnity).
