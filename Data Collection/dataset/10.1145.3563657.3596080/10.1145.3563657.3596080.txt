ABSTRACT 
Many cohabiting millennials report dissatisfaction about declining 
levels of sexual desire. Barriers such as desire discrepancy, lack 
of communication, changing needs, and habituality interfere with 
sexual desire and relationship satisfaction. This paper explores 
whether technology has a role in supporting and increasing sexual 
desire or developing an understanding of diferent individual needs 
towards sexual desire within couples’ relationships and how it can 
do so. To explore this, we conducted a survey (n=77) and inter-
view study (n=12). Results show that participants wanted a shared, 
dedicated, and protected space to playfully explore their individ-
ual desire with each other. They felt technology could facilitate 
a better understanding of their evolving needs as a couple, moti-
vate open sexual communication, bring spontaneity, and hands-on 
exploration; however, technology should not infict judgement or 
obligations on desire levels; it should help to understand and situate 
difering needs in a relationship meaningfully. We share our refec-
tions on the role of technology and raise important considerations 
in such technology design.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Many cohabiting millennials (people born between 1981 and 1996 
[25]) in Europe report that they experience a signifcantly lower 
level of sexual desire compared to earlier generations [13, 20, 111], 
while their wish to engage in sex has increased. Factors such as 
habituality (being controlled by old habits), poor body image [28],

https://doi.org/10.1145/3563657.3596080 and stress have been cited as reasons in the Western world that 
negatively impact sexual desire in cohabiting couples [31, 85, 95]. 
The larger discrepancy between the desired and experienced level of 
millennials’ sexual desire also point to contributing factors related 
to the introduction of technology in daily life, ’busyness with a 
modern life-style’ and increased levels of stress [9, 111]. Some USA-
based research shows that being satisfed in the experienced level 
of sexual desire may improve sexual and relationship satisfaction as 
well as overall wellbeing [60, 63, 76]. Although (digital) technology 
can have a negative infuence on cohabiting couples’ sexual desire 
[111], recent research and technical advances show that technology 
may also play a supporting role in sexual wellbeing and expression 
[6, 70]. However, HCI research has not explored how technology 
can support sexual desire or the mental side of sexuality within 
cohabiting couples, which Gibbs et al. already concluded in 2006 
[37]. Previous studies have either focused mainly on sex toys [29, 
41], sex robots [24], individuals (mostly women) [21, 52], or focused 
on tools supporting intimacy within couples in a long-distance 
relationship and co-located couples [ 5, 15, 115, 116]. Many of these 
products focus solely on sexual arousal in the moment, rather than 
increasing levels of sexual desire. Further, individuals within a 
relationship may have diferent levels of desire, and communicating 
or discussing such desire discrepancy or working to address it 
(by achieving an understanding of the discrepancy and what it 
means for the relationship, or increasing sexual desire if that is 
the goal) is not easy [64]. Thus, there is an opportunity here to 
explore if technology can play a role in supporting the exploration 
of cohabiting millennials’ sexual desire. What could this role be? 
To achieve this, two studies were carried out. The frst study was 
a survey of 77 cohabiting millennials (predominantly heterosexual) 
to investigate needs and factors afecting their sexual desire. Most 
participants in the study were from Western Europe and the UK. 
The second study was an interview study to further understand 
cohabiting millennials’ needs in exploring sexual desire and the 
role of technology. The second study had two parts, which included 
individual interviews with sketching activities with 8 participants, 
followed by a review of the sketches from the interviews by 11 
participants (7 of the 8 Study 2 participants and 4 newly recruited 
ones). 
To our knowledge, this research is the frst in providing (1) in-
sights into a playful interaction between users and technology to 
explore, understand and perhaps increase the satisfaction of their 
own and each others’ sexual desires, and (2) considerations and im-
plications on how technology could be used (and some caveats) in 
exploration of sexual desire in cohabiting millennial couples. This

study also provides insights into and considerations for conducting 
HCI sexuality research. 
2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
Sexual desire can be described as an inclination or urge to partici-
pate in sexual interactions [8] or to "achieve sexual intimacy" [60]. It 
stems from multiple forces that inhibit or stimulate people to engage 
in sexual activities [56], such as a biological drive, psychological mo-
tivation (individuals’ mental states, interpersonal states, and social 
circumstances), and cultural or social norms [56, 78, 80]. Various 
factors infuence individuals’ inclination or reluctance to partici-
pate in sexual activities [56]; they encompass biological impulses, 
psychological motivations (including mental states, interpersonal 
dynamics, and societal context), and cultural and social norms. It is 
a dynamic state that can vary widely, spanning from experiencing 
strong aversion towards the idea of engaging in sexual activities, 
to feeling intense passion accompanied by excitement and physical 
arousal [56]. 
Sexual desire is linked to individual wellbeing [55], as well as 
satisfaction within relationships [59, 64]. Difculties with sexual 
desire, such as habituality and desire discrepancy [61, 85, 95] are 
reported by many cohabiting millennials [11]. Facing difculties 
related to sexual desire, and discrepancy in sexual desire within a 
relationship, are among the most cited concerns for couples seeking 
therapy [30]. Desire discrepancy arises when partners in a relation-
ship have diferent levels of desire; thus one partner may experience 
a higher or lower level of desire than the other [ 64]. Further, each 
partner may experience regular and often predictable individual 
fuctuations in sexual desire due to a range of external factors such 
as hormonal changes or body image [28, 63, 109]. These natural 
ebbs and fows of desire, along with the fnding that if desire is 
low it is unlikely to change soon [ 109], make desire discrepancy a 
potentially unavoidable aspect of any relationship at some point, 
and one that could pose challenges for the relationship [44, 108]. 
Recent research has highlighted individual, interpersonal and so-
cial factors that impact sexual desire [63]. These factors encompass 
a wide range of infuences that shape an individual’s sexual desire. 
Individual factors include aspects such as personal characteristics, 
beliefs, experiences and feelings such as attraction to a partner [8], 
or stress [32]. Interpersonal factors include the dynamics, quality 
and length of relationships [2], level of communication [32, 76], 
and elements of unpredictability such as surprise, risk, playfulness, 
and innovative interactions [31, 32, 68], as well as relationship sat-
isfaction and intimacy, both physical and emotional [18, 32, 78, 94]. 
By fnding a balance between asserting individuality and fostering 
mutual intimacy in a relationship, couples can create a safe emo-
tional space for exploration and risk-taking [53]. This can involve 
engaging in novel experiences, which evokes greater sexual desire, 
even in long-term relationships [32]. Finally, social factors include 
broader societal and cultural norms and expectations, including 
aspects such as gendered roles [75], and attitudes towards sexual 
activity [18, 22]. 
Long-term partners employ various ways to sustain sexual desire, 
with an emphasis on enhancing relationship and sexual satisfaction. 
These strategies involve actively avoiding monotony, engaging in activities as a couple that foster novelty and experimentation, foster-
ing emotional intimacy and communication, and practicing mindful-
ness [63]. Several researchers have studied more specifc strategies 
and mechanisms that couples use for maintaining sexual desire 
and managing desire discrepancy in relationships [ 60, 62, 63, 108]. 
For example, one study [44] identifed strategies that women in 
long-term relationships used to deal with desire discrepancy, in-
cluding having sex without desire, scheduling sex, communication, 
and having patience. Although this study was among the frst to 
try to identify specifc strategies to address desire disparity in cou-
ples, it is important to note its limitations. The study sample solely 
comprised women, and its primary focus was on increasing and 
restoring desire, and getting it back on track, thereby framing desire 
discrepancy as a problem rather than acknowledging and managing 
naturally occurring and recurring instances of desire discrepancy. 
Building on this, a more recent study delved into the strategies used 
by both men and women in heterosexual relationships to address 
desire discrepancy [108]. Moreover, this study shed light on the 
signifcance of partnered strategies in managing and navigating 
desire disparities, such as efective communication, quality time 
spent together, and having sex anyway, in improving sexual and 
relationship satisfaction [108]. Recently, an online intervention 
was developed to address desire discrepancy and improve access 
to sex therapy as previous research has suggested that online in-
terventions may be particularly useful for sexual problems due to 
increased stigma associated with sex [ 107]. The intervention used 
online sensate focus therapy: "a series of structured touch exer-
cises that help couples to gradually habituate to the feared stimuli 
(i.e. sexual activity) and learn to be mindful and present in sexual 
encounters" [107]. The fndings highlighted the importance of com-
munication and addressing desire discrepancy together, rather than 
individually, to improve relationship satisfaction. However, some 
participants did not experience reduced desire discrepancy, and the 
author argued that this could be due to monotony in information 
and tasks in the application, lack of support in communication, and 
lack of personalisation [ 107]. While the sample size was too small 
to be generalisable, the fndings indicate potential for technology 
to support sexual desire [107]. 
Other studies suggest that open and afectionate communication 
and sharing of preferences about sex, intimacy or relationships 
could address discrepancies and even enhance desire [10, 78]. How-
ever, research also indicates that open communication with partners 
about sex can be a challenge specifcally faced by millennial couples 
[65]. This lack of communication, and shame and uncertainty of 
a partner’s reaction associated with arbitrary attempts of initia-
tion of sex [22, 43], can result in disappointment and withdrawal, 
frequently diminishing desire [67]. Sexual responsiveness and at-
tentiveness (letting the other feel desirable) are also important for 
desire [76, 85], and desire discrepancy needs negotiation to avoid 
negative consequences, as partner disappointment can stife sexual 
desire within couples [73, 78]. 
2.1 The role of technology in dwindling desire 
The "busyness of modern life", refected in the juggling of private 
space, work, and leisure - where these factors can also interact - can 
make it difcult to achieve intimacy and time for self. Longer work 
1843Exploring Sexual Desire DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
hours, commutes, and having children can all interfere. The cur-
rent ways of working with technology further blur the boundaries 
between work and leisure [3, 111] through introducing various 
distractions such as continuous notifcations from smartphones in 
daily life [31]. Although the impact of technology on erotic life 
is insufciently investigated [12], research shows that time spent 
online can interfere with meaningful face-to-face interactions [88], 
or interfere with the satisfaction of such interactions with common 
occurrences of ’phubbing ’ (snubbing a partner by using one’s phone 
during interaction), negatively afecting sexual desire [69, 89, 97]. 
These factors can also contribute to stress and mental health issues, 
the biggest known factors diminishing (the motivation to experi-
ence) sexual desire [ 32, 81, 95]. They also contribute to a negative 
work/home balance [ 102], and a perception of lack of time in gen-
eral [95]. The constant availability of entertainment, and use of 
smartphones, have reportedly led to fewer opportunities for feeling 
desire and initiating sexual activity due to the many choices of 
things for people to do instead of engaging in amorous activities 
[105]. This factor is important when thinking of designing technol-
ogy for enhancing or exploring sexual desire, as technology itself 
can potentially become a barrier. In addition, individuals can be 
infuenced by societal norms regarding sexual desire, which are 
perpetuated through media portrayals that often pathologize "low" 
sexual desire, while reinforcing gender stereotypes that expect men 
to display higher levels of sexual desire compared to women. There 
is also the prevailing assumption that low sexual desire among 
women in heterosexual relationships is a problem, leading to a re-
search focus on investigating its causes and potential treatments 
exclusively aimed at women [106]. These societal norms contribute 
to unrealistic expectations and coping mechanisms around sexu-
ality and body image [19]. More recently, however, (social) media 
has also shifted more towards a sex-positive perspective which 
has shown to have a positive impact on sexual scripts and sexual 
communication [112], illustrating how technology and media can 
also be a potential enabler in supporting couples’ sexual desire, and 
communicating desire, when being exposed to helpful information. 
2.2 Sexual desire in HCI 
Currently, HCI focuses increasingly on subjective interactions and 
aesthetics, and embracing other dimensions of interaction such 
as emotion, experience, pleasure, embodiment, and physical inti-
macy, including an important space for sexual wellbeing [6] and 
desire [ 49, 86]. There has been increasing interest in designing for 
sexual intimacy [ 47], but, to our knowledge, HCI research has not 
yet explored how technology can support sexual desire in cohabit-
ing couples [17, 37], or focuses on addressing their challenges in 
sexual desire, such as desire discrepancy, in a pathologising way. 
Through this paper, we aim to propose a space for opportunities in 
technology to playfully explore pleasurable interactions aimed at 
promoting sexual desire, not just with a focus on addressing defcits 
and gaps in the literature. 
2.2.1 Principles for designing for desire. Earlier research has fo-
cused on principles for designing for desire. Work by Bertelsen and 
Petersen suggests providing an enabling context for erotic desire or 
activities to occur [12] by treating sexual practice and eroticism as part of everyday life and designing for fun. This can create new per-
spectives and ways for exercising eroticism in a playful way with 
technology, rather than focusing on prevalent medical approaches 
[12]. They suggest designing for illogical combinations, unexpected 
openings, and inventiveness in sexual activities. These design sug-
gestions are also reported by Eaglin and Bardzell, who conducted 
user research on the use of sex toys [ 29], and further suggest that 
the product should not dictate its purpose so users can explore and 
appropriate them, as sexual desire is personal [29]. Thus, designers 
should be mindful of how much control or responsibility they take 
in the use of the product and what implications this might have 
on users’ sex life and desire [41]. However, these interactions or 
patterns when designing for desire need further investigation in 
HCI as they need input from users. 
2.2.2 Design proposals for intimacy and sexuality. The focus of 
many HCI studies on couples about intimacy has been on long-
distance relationships. Products explore mitigating the physical 
distance between partners by mimicking a feeling of presence us-
ing audio-and video streaming [5], robots [115], VR [116] and smart 
everyday objects [ 40]. Some products also focus on physical inti-
macy, mimicking cuddling or stroking [72] and kissing through 
haptics [93]. However, long-distance relationships face diferent 
challenges in maintaining desire from cohabiting couples, as being 
separated physically can be a factor in fuelling desire [85]. Less 
research has explored cohabiting or co-located couples, and mainly 
explored ways of promoting non-sexual interpersonal sharing by, 
for example, using a shared diary [15]. A similar product ’Whispers’ 
enabled communication of physiological data between partners 
through haptics and sound, allowing shared embodiment [54]. This 
may facilitate playfulness and unexpected openings as Bertelsen 
and Petersen [12] suggested when designing for desire. While these 
studies may have a positive efect on sexual desire, also due to their 
focus on increasing intimacy [31], they did not explicitly focus on 
this aspect. 
Some studies have focused on facilitating sexual activity through 
tools for pleasure and tactile stimulation [6] (e.g., OhMiBod: a vibra-
tor that vibrates on your favourite music) [29] to enhance pleasure 
and sexual expression. Other studies report on the development 
and evaluation of products for sexuality, focusing on sexual dis-
covery, arousal through simulations of sex using VR, sex robots, 
pornography [7, 24, 74], and normalisation of female genitals [52]. 
The latter,"Cunt touch this" [52], is an interactive game that stim-
ulates people to colour a vulva (which makes sounds depending 
on where the player touches the screen/vulva). A less explicit in-
teractive example is the multiplayer game ’Talk About Sex’ that 
presents challenges players need to execute in turn, building in 
exercises on consent, intimacy, trust, and building momentum for 
intimacy [113]. Here, similar principles have been used to what Ber-
telsen and Petersen suggested when designing for desire [12]. Some 
products support existing sexual desires or enacting them, such as: 
IJustMadeLove.com [49]: a social media site where users share that 
they had sex by setting markers on a map and commenting on each 
other’s markers. The elements of exhibitionism and voyeurism in a 
private environment enable people to freely express their sexual 
desires. Seeing markers of recent sexual activity close by (physical 
proximity) may induce arousal [49]. While these products do not 
1844DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA van Greevenbroek et al. 
explicitly focus on sexual desire, they may have a role in promoting 
sexual discovery and normalisation as suggested by Bertelsen and 
Petersen [12], which may afect cohabiting couples’ sexual desire. 
However, none of these studies have reported any specifc fndings 
or implications on this. 
Several promising commercial technologies deal with challenges 
couples have in arousing sexual desire, such as Wheel of Foreplay 
[84], Coral [36], and Lover [58]. They bring in elements of sex ther-
apy and education, prompts and exercises to do with a partner, and 
personalisation, to help couples communicate and explore. Inter-
estingly, they feature many of the design principles mentioned by 
Bertelsen and Peterson [12], Eaglin and Bardzell [29], and Goodman 
and Vertesi[ 41]. However, the efect of these on cohabiting couples’ 
sexual desire and the underlying contributing mechanisms have 
not been investigated. 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
Our research aimed to unpack needs around sexual desire among co-
habiting millennials and if technology could be a medium to explore, 
communicate and support sexual desire when needed. We further 
investigated needs and associated design requirements with respect 
to technology in this space. We conducted two studies: (i) an online 
mixed methods survey to understand the initial characteristics and 
needs for millennials’ sexual desire and their technology use, and 
(ii) online interviews with participatory sketching activities to ex-
plore how they envisioned technology could support these needs. 
The results from the frst study were used to create data-driven 
personas (fctional characters that represent a user group and their 
goals, behaviours, challenges and motivations), which informed and 
were used in the subsequent study. The second study had two parts: 
the frst involved 8 individual interviews with sketching activities 
and using the personas. This was followed by the second part, an 
anonymous review of sketches resulting from the interviews to 
clarify insights, probe to deepen requirements, and gather feedback 
or new ideas that may emerge from other’s sketches. Sketches were 
reviewed through a short survey with the Study 2 participants, and 
short interviews with 4 additionally recruited participants to reduce 
any biases and validate the generalisability of the needs of this user 
group. 
3.1 Ethical considerations 
This study was ethically approved by (anonymous for review). 
Given the sensitive topic of our research, we were careful to frame 
questions in a way that would not cause any distress or embarrass-
ment. We piloted all questions to avoid (harmful) misinterpretation 
and stressed to participants that they should only share what they 
felt comfortable with and that they could refrain from answering 
any questions. We used personas so that participants had the choice 
to answer questions from the persona’s perspective or their own. 
Data was gathered and stored securely on Microsoft Teams and Red-
cap. The project was approved by the department ethics committee 
and all data collected was subject to Data Protection regulations. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all studies were conducted online. 3.2 A note on positionality 
We believe it is important to refect on our positionality regard-
ing this work. Our approach in undertaking this work is not to 
problematise desire (or the lack of it), or to treat it as a medical or 
health issue. We do not subscribe to the medical model in which 
low desire is considered a disorder, or regard it as a "women’s prob-
lem". Rather we are curious about how technology (as a tool or 
actor) could mediate desire in relationships by allowing people to 
explore and discover what brings them pleasure and satisfaction, 
in a playful and non-judgmental way, individually and within their 
relationships. Could technology, so ubiquitous in our daily lives, 
help to overcome some of the barriers and reservations people have 
towards exploring their own and others’ desire with an open and 
curious mindset? Could it help to bridge gaps? We know that tech-
nology has the reverse role to play as well. Much has been said 
about the role of technology as a distractor that takes away from 
intimacy and interferes with sexual desire. But we explore how 
people want to use it to facilitate closeness in relationships and 
communication. 
4 STUDY 1: ONLINE SURVEY 
4.1 Method 
We created an anonymous online survey as they are associated 
with more open self-disclosures on personal topics such as sexual 
thoughts and behaviours [38]. The survey consisted of questions 
selected from validated questionnaires measuring sexual desire, 
such as the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Desire (HISD) [ 4], Sexual De-
sire Questionnaire (DESQ) [23], the Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI) 
[96], the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) [91], and Brief Sexual 
Function Inventory (BSFI) [79] and questions that were informed by 
psycho-sociological factors impacting sexual desire from the litera-
ture [63]. Open questions also considered the impact COVID-19 had 
had on their sexual desire, their behaviours and experience in prod-
ucts used to support their desire, and needs in future technology. To 
protect participants’ privacy as they were recruited conveniently, 
questions regarding their background were limited to age, sexual 
orientation, and gender identity. Six participants piloted the survey, 
which was refned based on their feedback. 
4.1.1 Recruitment. We aimed to recruit a diverse group of partici-
pants (same-sex, heterosexual, polygamous, monogamous, diferent 
ethnicities and cultural backgrounds) to explore whether people 
in diferent relationships and contexts had distinct requirements 
for technology. Inclusion criteria were: participants aged between 
24-39 years old, cohabiting for more than 6 months with a partner, 
able to give informed consent, and to communicate efectively in 
English. We did not restrict participation based on gender iden-
tity or sexuality. Participants were recruited through social media 
platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn with a link to the survey 
and snowballing approaches. All respondents provided digital con-
sent. At the end of the survey, participants had a choice to opt-in 
for a follow-up interview with participatory sketching activities 
(Study 2). Participants were asked to bring a partner or friend to 
the interview. 
4.1.2 Participants. The survey sample consisted of 77 participants 
(44 identifed as women, 32 identifed as men, 1 preferred not to 
1845Exploring Sexual Desire DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
say), mostly aged between 24-27(48.1%, n=37), 28-31(28.6%, n=22), 
32-35 (19%, n=15) and 36-39 (3.9%, n=3), mostly heterosexual (96%), 
in a relationship for between 2 to 4 years (35.1%, n=27), with others 
between 6-12 months (3.9%, n=3), 1-2 years (11.7%, n=9), 4-8 years 
(27.3%, n=21), 8-12 years (14.3%, n=11) and more than 12 years (7.8%, 
n=6). Most participants did not have children, (84.4%, n=65), 3 were 
pregnant (3.9%), 8 had one child (10.4%) and 2 had between 2 and 4 
children (2.6%). 
4.1.3 Data analysis. We frst carried out a descriptive analysis of 
the quantitative survey data and further multiple two-step cluster 
analyses [104] to determine the best ft for the data in clusters and 
construct data-driven personas. The frst analysis was done to clus-
ter participants based on all variables of the survey to identify clus-
tering variables, which yielded 10 clusters with weak consistency. 
In the next iterations, weak clustering variables were excluded one 
by one until the cluster analysis yielded a result of 5 coherent clus-
ters, which eventually were based on descriptive variables and the 
variables that depicted goals, needs, behaviours and frustrations 
(status and satisfaction of sexual desire and the agree-disagree ques-
tions on factors impacting desire). Data on the open qualitative 
questions were analysed using content analysis [66]. Descriptive 
statistics were generated per cluster to inform the personas, where 
answers from open questions within a cluster were compared and 
summarized. 
4.2 Survey Results 
In this section we present a short summary of the relevant fndings 
from the online survey. 
4.2.1 The sexual desire of cohabiting millennials. Most respondents 
(83%) thought sex was important; 64% considered a lack of sexual 
desire a problem (see Figure 1). The frequency of experienced sexual 
desire ranged from multiple times a week to multiple times a day, 
where 42% wanted to experience more desire, and 38% did not know 
how to increase this. Females wanted to feel sexual desire more 
often. However, this was not signifcant ( 2(4, N = 77) = 8.33, p 
= .08). Males reported experiencing desire more often ( 2(14, N 
= 77) = 33.80, p < .05), and engaging in sexual activities ( 2(14, 
N = 77) = 48.87, p <.001). Younger participants (aged 24-27) also 
reported engaging in sexual activities more often ( 2(21, N = 77) = 
36.03, p < .05). The frequency of sexual activity ranged from once 
every 2-weeks to 3-4 times a week. This was signifcantly lower 
for people in relationships of 4-years and longer ( 2(35, N = 77) 
= 67.02, p <.001). Though this was not the case for participants in 
a relationship of 2-years or longer, they nonetheless signifcantly 
reported not experiencing sexual desire as often as they liked ( 2(10, 
N = 77) = 25.88, p < .05) and not engaging in sexual activities as 
much as they’d like ( 2(10, N = 77) = 19.10, p < .05). About 55% 
of all participants wanted to engage in more sexual activities. On 
average, people determined their sex life satisfaction to be a 6.5 (SD 
= 2.29) on a scale of 0 (absolutely not satisfed) to 10 (absolutely 
satisfed). People in relationships of 4-years and longer reported 
lower numbers, but this was not signifcant (  2(50, N = 75) = 64.06, 
p = .09). No other signifcant diferences were found for age, gender, 
or people with/without children. A large proportion engaged in 
sex for positive reasons, such as their partner’s pleasure (91%), their own pleasure (88%), and for emotional intimacy (86%). A ffth, 
however, engaged in sex because they felt they should (20%). 
4.2.2 Frustrations. Communication about sexual desire with part-
ners was reported to be difcult. While 83% knew what they liked 
during sex, a lesser proportion (57%) regularly discussed this with 
their partner. 60% reported a discrepancy between their sexual de-
sire and their partner’s. This was signifcantly more in people in 
relationships of 2 years and more (  2(20, N = 77) = 37.27, p < .05); 
around half (46%) reported experiencing stress, with more than a 
quarter experiencing depression and/or anxiety or not enough time 
and/or energy to feel sexual desire (28%). Nearly a quarter (23%) 
of the participants reported that their technology/smartphone use 
afected their desire negatively, and their partners’ use afected it 
even more (31%). Around half (53%) of the participants reported 
putting efort into maintaining sexual desire weekly to monthly, 
and most reported trying (and wanting to try) new things (66%). 
4.2.3 Creating future products for sexual desire. 55% of respondents 
used technology products in their sex life (mostly to enhance bodily 
arousal using sex toys (71%)). In addition, participants who had 
never used technology for sexual purposes (44%) reported being 
open to exploring technology for sexual desire. Those who used 
technology for their sex life (39%), however, explained they had less 
time for sex in general and thus did not use the products often. 
Three diferent general opinions were identifed on how tech-
nology could be used to explore sexual desire: (1) by supporting 
the path to arousal, in particular communication, (2) by helping to 
break the routine (e.g. suggesting novelties, knowledge on sexual 
possibilities and seduction), and (3) by helping to understand (dif-
ferences in) sexual needs and assisting couples to understand one 
another (e.g. through "erotic mindfulness" - survey respondent). 
Respondents prioritised discretion, privacy, to-the-point messaging, 
personalisation and low stress and time commitment as require-
ments for technology. 
4.3 Developing Personas 
We created fve data-driven personas, based on the cluster analysis 
of the survey data, that covered a combination of various sexual 
desires, frustrations and goals. We kept the type of relationship 
open so monogamous and non-monogamous participants would 
be able to identify with all personas. Persona ’Charlie’, the largest 
cluster, represented people who struggled to fnd time to feel sexual 
desire and felt uninspired (see Figure 2). Other personas included 
representations of people with a high sexual desire who wanted to 
make their sex life even more fun, those with a higher sexual desire 
who had a discrepancy with their partner, people who found it 
difcult to feel sexual desire and wanted to explore how they could 
enjoy it more, and those who would like to experience more sexual 
desire but struggled to move from intimacy to feeling sexual in a 
non-threatening way. Personas were given non-gendered names, 
and illustrations were varied among diferent personas based on 
the participant. Though there were some signifcant diferences 
among men and women in regards to wanting to feel more desire 
and sexual activity, we tried to avoid biases of gender roles to allow 
people to identify themselves with personas.

5 STUDY 2: ONLINE INTERVIEW WITH 
PARTICIPATORY SKETCHING ACTIVITIES 
5.1 Method 
We used the data-driven personas created in Study 1 in our in-
terviews, as intimate information is often linked with feelings of 
embarrassment or shame [71] and using personas in interviews 
or participatory design has been shown as helpful to mitigate this 
while enhancing introspection and creativity [103, 104]. Partic-
ipants could opt to answer questions from their perspective or 
shield behind the personas [45] as it helps to decrease the distance 
between researcher and participant [45]. During the interview par-
ticipants were asked to choose two personas to form a couple, so they would also be prompted to think about a partner’s perspective 
and the relationship. 
We constructed an open topic guide to investigate diferent chal-
lenges and needs in exploring sexual desire, and if there was a space 
for technology to support this. During discussions around problems, 
needs and requirements, participants were also asked to explain 
and/ or sketch if they proposed technology to envision how it could 
be used to explore sexual desire, what they felt it would look like, 
behave, should (not) have, how it should make them feel, what 
it could achieve and scenarios of use. These sketching activities 
helped participants formulate and specify their needs and ideas 
more concretely, which is proven helpful in communicating and 
1847Exploring Sexual Desire DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
contextualising design concepts [110]. A collaborative web white-
board ( ’Miro’) was used for sketching. Sketches mostly focused on 
a product or service itself, rather then providing a detailed context. 
The context (where it could be used, how it behaved over time) was 
either captured in annotations or narrated during the interview 
and thematically analysed afterwards. Some participants found it 
difcult to ideate, visualise and sketch their ideas online. In these 
cases the researcher sketched things out while probing and crys-
tallising participants’ ideas and needs. After the sketching activities, 
participants were asked about their thoughts on the most helpful, 
challenging and unhelpful ideas discussed during the session. 
To gain a deeper and wider understanding of needs and ideas 
from Study 1, with permission gained during the interviews, partic-
ipants’ anonymised ideas and sketches were shared. Three weeks 
after the interviews, participants were asked to evaluate the probes 
on their own, using a separate document which contained all of the 
sketches and ideas. For each, four questions were asked: what do 
you like about this? what do you like less / would change? What 
questions did it raise? What other ideas could be considered? This 
method was chosen as these participants knew the study, could do 
this in their own time and could provide feedback on others’ ideas 
unrestrained. In parallel, an additional four participants took part in 
an interview to explore and evaluate the probes in an unbiased way 
as they had not been involved in the research yet and would not be 
subjected to the IKEA efect [82] - a cognitive bias where people put 
signifcantly more value on things they have helped to create. We 
wanted to explore enthusiasm for ideas that existing participants 
came up with, and the generalisability of their needs related to the 
ideas. They were free to annotate or extend the presented ideas. 
5.1.1 Recruitment. All participants provided informed consent to 
participate in the study and were provided options for their pre-
ferred mode of participating (video conferencing, audio confer-
encing or instant messaging in Microsoft Teams). All participants 
were provided with an option to bring a partner or friend to the 
interview who would be equally compensated. This option was 
provided in case people may want to discuss ideas in the presence 
of a partner or in case they felt more comfortable attending with 
a known person, considering the topic. However, no participant 
expressed interest in bringing a partner or friend to the interview. 
Participants in the interviews received a £15 Amazon voucher and 
those in the follow-up interviews received a £10 Amazon voucher. 
5.1.2 Participants. The eight participants (4 female, 4 male, all 
heterosexual) were between 25 and 35 years old. Their cohabiting 
relationship duration ranged from 4 to 11 years; one was in an open 
relationship while the rest were in a monogamous relationship; 
only one participant had children. The four additional participants 
taking part in the follow-up interview (3 males and 1 female, all 
heterosexual) were aged between 24 and 29 years, in cohabiting, 
monogamous relationships of between 3.5 and 10 years long, and 
had no children. 
5.1.3 Data analysis. All interviews were held in Microsoft Teams 
and were recorded with consent. Audio recordings of the inter-
views were transcribed by the frst author. Transcriptions were 
analysed using inductive thematic analysis [16]. After transcribing 
and familiarisation (phase one), initial codes were generated by the frst author (phase two) where key observations were extracted and 
interpreted. Afnity diagrams were used to group themes (phase 
three), which were agreed by the three authors and iteratively 
refned. Data from the autonomous review of the sketches and 
the further short interviews were analysed using content analysis 
where patterns were identifed in participants’ answers and anal-
ysed data were analysed in light of the earlier identifed themes. 
Findings from all studies are presented together in the following 
section for coherence and richer insights. 
5.2 Results 
The use of personas was reported to be particularly helpful during 
interviews, as it helped participants recognise and compare aspects 
of their sex life and discuss these openly with the researcher. Inter-
estingly, most participants reported choosing personas in the ses-
sion that refected their own relationship. Additionally, the sketch-
ing activities motivated participants to be specifc in their needs 
and requirements. See Figure 3 for some examples of the sketches 
and below a short explanation of the design ideas which we discuss 
in further detail in the results section. 
Explanation of the sketches in Figure 3: 
• Ideas on design elements for digital products: either light 
and soft, or dark and sexy

creet 
• ‘Challenges’ to do with a partner with video or audio support 
• Vibrating physical artefact that can help to remind to do

• An app containing online workshops to do with a partner and 
being able to select randomly, send to a partner to surprise 
them or choose one to do by themselves 
• Exploring preferences by swiping diferent prompts left/right 
that would specify preferences based on answers 
• Being able to specify preferences into details (‘soft’, ‘hard-

• Sex Pictionary (as an ‘ice breaker’) 
• Features that validates a person’s or couples’ situation (how 
certain barriers impact the relationship, personas to identify 
with) 
• Ideas on enabling enough fexibility for personal (changing) 
preferences (for both partners individually), like being able 
put in likes but also dislikes, provide feedback, and ability 
to always change preferences. Or ‘snooze’ (temporarily) dis-
abling the product to move with the ebb and fow of sexual 
desire

We conclude with specifc requirements extracted per theme. 
5.2.1 Keeping in step with a changing other. Participants expressed 
that doing new things with their partner was exciting and wanted 
to have more open communication about sexual desires without 
the pressure of having sex. However, after the initial years of their 
relationship, they felt their partner and their desires were well-
known, familiar and safe, resulting in fewer eforts at discovering 
new things about their partners. Participants often had mixed and 
often contrasting views on sexual desire which could lead to passiv-
ity. On the one hand, most participants expressed that it was normal 
that sexual desire ebbs and fows in relationships and may decline 
over time. But on the other hand, many felt that they wanted them 
and their partners to work on their sexual desire actively. However, 
they did not always know how to do this in practice. P8: "I don’t 
like the idea of having a Disney relationship where boy meets girls 
and they are happy forever. That is not realistic. But then at the same 
time, I don’t really know how to otherwise do it. " There was a tension between the efect of habituality and routine 
versus spontaneity and the element of surprise. Some reported the 
presence of spontaneous sexual encounters in the beginning of their 
relationships, but that these moments often declined with time in 
long-term relationships; some participants spoke about slipping 
into old routines (with each other) easily, leading to habituality. 
P4: "Most of the times we just go sit on the couch and then relax a 
little bit. And then you go to bed too late actually. You don’t want to 
go upstairs especially to have sex. ". Many participants reported that 
they wanted to have more spontaneous moments or situations that 
"ft these kinds of conversations " but ended up waiting for something 
to happen rather than working on creating opportunities to act on 
their sexual desire. Some who tried to bring variety to their sex life 
reported difculties in maintaining this in the long-term and that 
they slipped back into old routines easily. 
Participants felt that this was an aspect that technology could 
help with. P8: "You have to put efort in to discover new things. If you 
don’t get help, it is much harder. If you have a product that can guide 
you.. " Participants felt technology could be an enabler of unplanned 
and unexpected encounters, which circumvent the confict in the be-
liefs participants held. Spontaneous prompts from technology could 
1849Exploring Sexual Desire DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
help them to create and encounter (perhaps serendipitous) possibil-
ities for feeling sexual desire more naturally. Participants felt this 
would bring inspiration, curiosity and motivation to experience 
new sexual things with their partner. Ideas included suggestions for 
spontaneous prompts for gestures they could do for themselves and 
their partner (e.g. dress to feel attractive, prepare for a date by buy-
ing something for their partner). Most participants felt spontaneous 
prompts could be key in igniting or maintaining sexual desire and 
building momentum to act. P4: "When it is spontaneous or random 
moments, it makes you [think] more on your feet or something, that 
you also get more sexual desire overall. Like ‘maybe there is something 
happening today’. " 
Participants proposed playful ideas that could include both part-
ners. For example, one proposed an app that could notify couples 
synchronously on questions or set up joint adventures and prepare 
the couple for a ’surprise date’. Both partners would have something 
to look forward to as each would receive diferent instructions to 
prepare. Many other participants felt this was could be a good way 
to stimulate and create space for desire to arise, as it would take 
the "unsexy planning element out of it" (P11). 
5.2.2 Creating a space for "us" to feel desire. Participants stressed 
the importance of making time for one another to provide a space 
where desire can arise. However, many participants experienced 
difculty in fnding or making the time to have such conversations. 
Participants promoted the idea of sexual desire as a state, a space 
you go to, and they proposed ideas for technology to facilitate such 
a separate, dedicated space or product for sexual desire. They felt 
that it would be exciting to create a space or object that they shared 
only with a partner. For example, something that appeared like an 
"everyday object or app", discrete, secret and unassuming. Using this 
secret product would also emphasise the efort they were putting 
into feeling sexual desire and being desirable. They also proposed 
ideas for secret technologies (e.g. a code protected digital platform) 
that would facilitate remote foreplay and create space for desire 
when being apart during the day. P5: "When I have the app, my 
partner should have an app as well and that would make it sexy. So 
you have it together. " In this, participants felt that a digital platform 
separate from their commonly used instant messaging platforms 
could help focus on desire and even enable positive associations. 
P2: "If you are working and you see the app pops up, then you’re like 
oh this is not something like .. ’who is going to do the groceries’. I have 
to open it in private, which would trigger that excitement. " 
Participants expressed the need to engage diferent bodily senses 
and sensations, in addition to exciting the imagination or purely 
visual sense. Some expressed the idea of a physical technology 
artefact, an unassuming and hidden product, that would produce vi-
brations or sounds to communicate desire to a partner at a distance 
and many participants were positive about this. Many participants 
enjoyed the thought of naturally encountering the product in their 
environment. They felt just seeing such a product in their envi-
ronment would be exciting and further expressed that they would 
enjoy being surprised by their partner through bodily senses. They 
explained that through this, a space for desire would already be 
created before they were together and that this would make it easy 
to intimately engage with each other. Being at a distance from each 
other during the day and communicating desire, without being able to act on it, was exciting. Others felt that they would like 
to experience external sensory stimuli that could spark and help 
them focus on sexual thoughts through, for example, certain scents, 
lighting, and seeing or reading sex-related content, and technology 
could help in suggesting and actuating this. In this, participants 
highlighted that unexpected but perceptible and concrete stimuli 
were the most likely to stimulate fantasy and feelings of desire. 
These ideas are similar to those explored around twenty years ago 
[37, 99] that emphasised the potential for technology to mediate 
indicative, expressive and emotive interactions. 
In participants’ ideas, the technology creating a dedicated space 
for desire should also be protected from external distractions. This 
was important as participants expressed often being distracted by 
technology, such as use of TV and smartphones (and notifcations) 
in bed even when with their partners. Some also mentioned being 
mentally and physically distracted by their work while being at 
home. Participants felt that their to-do lists and digital interactions 
such as "phubbing" came in the way of having spontaneous intimate 
communication with their partner. P6: "What happens frequently is 
you wake up and read the news and get stuck on Twitter or something. 
And then they leave, and you don’t have a meaningful conversation 
before they come home in the evening." One participant outlined 
an app idea in which all notifcations would be blocked when the 
app (for sexual desire) is active, to prevent distractions impacting 
their mood and desire levels. Other participants underpinned this 
and argued it to be particularly essential when a digital product 
is used during sexual activities, and that therefore it should have 
diferent modes (e.g. do not disturb) that are easily accessed or 
defaults. In these suggestions, we recognise the conundrum that 
technology solutions are proposed for a problem that is partly 
caused by technology-mediated distraction. 
Moreover, participants argued that the type of technology itself 
is important in creating a dedicated space for desire. For example, 
they explained that a screen would be less natural and more dis-
tracting to use, especially as part of sexual activities as they would 
need to divide their attention between a screen and their partner(s). 
Therefore, participants thought that the user interface elements 
should be minimal and discreet and almost disappear during in-
active states, and have minimal screen interactions and options 
during active states. P3 "When you see an assignment or question you 
can push pause and then it goes black. Then you would want to put 
it away for a while, talk to each other, maybe have sex. So it should 
be really minimal." This would reduce distractions and maintain 
sexual desire in the moment. Alternatively, participants suggested 
that the product could also be voice-controlled or that they could 
listen to intimate audio stories or instructions without interacting 
with a device. 
5.2.3 Exploring desire playfully without shame. Several partici-
pants and/or their partners knew what they liked in sex or wanted 
from their partner, but expressed feeling ashamed, vulnerable and 
mostly afraid of being judged by their partner. This prevented them 
from initiating sex, feeling desire and openly discussing sexual 
matters. P6: "We live in a world that everything is cool, at least in 
the world I live in. [...] but when it comes to things that you would 
desire in bed, then there is immediately something telling me ’That is 
sick’, you know? You don’t even think or talk about it. ". Participants 
1850DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA van Greevenbroek et al. 
proposed that any technological solution in this space should focus 
on overcoming feelings of vulnerability and awkwardness in inter-
actions for initiating any sexual actions and improving exploration 
and playfulness. 
To overcome such feelings, many participants proposed technol-
ogy to randomly prompt challenges and ask questions to individuals. 
Participants felt that they could be more comfortable in exploring 
new ideas if they were asked or told to do something (such as by 
ideas in an agreed technology) P2: "It’s easier to do something if 
you are just told ‘okay you are going to do this now’. Then you don’t 
have to feel weird about it, don’t have to feel shame about selecting 
that type of action. " Additionally, a few participants also proposed 
the use of synchronisation. Some ideas included technology that 
would prompt the same challenges and questions to a couple at 
the same time. This would remove the need to initiate creating a 
space for desire. Some felt that sharing thoughts at the same time 
could help people feel less vulnerable and express themselves more 
authentically. However, participants wanted to be able to indicate 
how often they would like to receive spontaneous prompts as there 
may be times when they did not want to engage in thoughts about 
desire. Other participants proposed submitting ideas or thoughts 
to an app on a sexual topic or question at the same time. 
Participants also suggested that technologies could provide ideas 
for couples based on their individual preferences, which would 
enable them to see how their desires match their partner’s. It could 
help to initiate and introduce new topics for conversations as they 
would know their partner amenable and in the same mood but it 
should not guide the conversation. A few participants explained 
this could be helpful when experiencing desire discrepancies, where 
discrepancies either led to feeling rejected and ashamed, or to feel-
ing pressured and holding of sexual activities and feeling guilty 
by this towards their partner. P3: "He is less inclined to react to my 
initiatives and that makes me feel rejected. And the behaviour [initia-
tives] just diminishes because it is risky. ". In this case the participant 
felt that knowing more about her partner’s needs and expectations 
and having more open conversations related to sexual desire and 
encounters could help them to understand each other, without 
judgement. Participants explained that the suggestions based on 
partners’ individual preferences, could also lie in-between partners’ 
wants and needs to explore compromises in their diferences, re-
ducing the risk of receiving content people might feel pressured 
about. 
The right tone of voice of the product was often mentioned in 
ideas from participants. Participants explained that any product 
needs to create a safe space for everyone to avoid any feelings of 
shame and let all people feel accepted in their sexuality. Many felt 
that technology should aim to be "normalising" of diferent experi-
ences and needs, "encouraging" to try new things or of their ideas, 
and "fun". P4: "Maybe it has information about that there is not one 
normal so that everything is OK. It should be very inclusive. " People 
felt that there was a need for normalising and contextualising difer-
ent experiences and diferent levels of sexual desire and providing 
prompts accordingly. P7: "So, you are not just getting asked; what is 
the problem with your sexual life? [...] Your personas also triggered 
my thoughts and made me think about it again. I think this is just 
very helpful, you feel like you are not alone, and you don’t have to 
start from scratch. " Some participants suggested a digital tool providing topics with 
stories of other people where questions or challenges would be 
attached to, which exemplifed a need for context. Participants 
thought that it would help to compare other stories with themselves 
to normalise concepts and desires, get new perspectives, and make 
it easier to start talking about desires with their partner. P6: "You 
can discuss things that are not so personally related to yourself. It is 
easier to have these framed desires instead of saying ‘I want to do this 
or that’. " 
In order to maintain a safe space for everyone, all participants 
were concerned with the absolute need for transparency about 
data management and its privacy and security so that users are 
able to trust the product. Many wanted options to stay anonymous 
while using the product and that any (encrypted) data be stored 
on the product or device itself and not on the cloud or elsewhere. 
P5: "I just want the feeling that it is really discreet and safe to use, 
especially in our time. We are used to being like on the lookout, and 
it’s not sexy.". Participants thought technologies should explicitly 
mention how data was handled, encrypted and what was shared 
with their partner, as participants indicated not wanting to share 
all information with a partner. 
5.2.4 Developing sexual wellness knowledge. Many participants 
reported not having encountered much information in the past to 
learn about sexual desire, due to superfciality of resources and 
lack of concrete guidance to implement the information in daily 
life. Participants’ lack of knowledge and exploration seemed to 
make it challenging for them to bring variety and stimulation to 
their relationship and continue this sexual conversation. P2: "We 
only talk about sex right now when there is a problem because it 
feels like the rest have been said." Feeling uninspired in their sex 
life and not knowing how to improve intimacy with their partner 
was a much-expressed problem participants faced. Although some 
participants mentioned they talked openly about sex with their 
partner, they also had a hard time knowing and exploring what 
(new things) they liked or had a partner who did not know what 
they liked. Many reported wanting to learn new things about their 
partners’ and their own sexual desire and to do things that pushed 
their boundaries and break their routines: things they would not 
have thought of or done before. P5 "Like a candy shop with all those 
forbidden fruits. These are all possibilities I can try I haven’t even 
thought about and that feeling is really priceless and hot, I think". 
Some participants reported attempts to fnd information, but 
found resources that felt like either too big a hurdle (such as attend-
ing a sex workshop), biased, or superfcial. At other times they were 
inappropriate. P4: "Most of the time you type in something sexual, 
you get porn sites or some lame health government website where 
everything is too medical. It is difcult to flter it for yourself". 
Participants proposed many ideas, focusing on helping individu-
als and couples encounter, think and talk about new possibilities. 
Conceptual products included tangible and digital solutions that 
suggested or reminded them of possibilities of things they could 
explore. P6: "I would like those products to help me to see something 
in life that I might have missed otherwise.[....] I want it to encounter 
me in a situation I would not be in without this technology. " 
On the one hand, participants indicated that the product should 
suggest practical ways of discovering sexual desire by carrying 
1851Exploring Sexual Desire DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
out concrete, step-by-step, explicit actions; exploring by doing. For 
example, individual challenges (to surprise a partner), challenges to 
perform together, new Kamasutra positions, non-interactive audio-
guided sex workshops or erotic mindfulness sessions based on 
topics (such as balancing autonomy/intimacy) or new techniques. 
P4: "Together you try something new, you fnd new information and 
new ways to do things and by doing it together it is exciting." They 
highlighted the importance of the user interface being easy to co-
explore. P8:"You could do challenges that you cannot touch each other 
for a few days [..]. But you could also do it more emotionally, like 
introducing ‘a third’, post your image online, or go all the way by 
having actual threesomes. There is a whole range of things you could 
do. " 
On the other hand, participants highlighted some topics would 
require more thought and users probably may not feel comfortable 
trying it right away, or at all. Participants suggested that a digital 
product could provide thought-triggering questions and topics to 
get more knowledge on their (and partners’) sexual desire, current 
situation and relationship. 
The suggested ideas were caveated often with the need for per-
sonalising content as participants reasoned that some people would 
want boundary-pushing content while others would want subtler 
content, still focusing on increasing intimacy but not ’too weird or 
crazy’. Users wanted to be able to indicate their preferences indi-
vidually, with the opportunity to match these with their partners’. 
Participants acknowledged that sexual desire is highly personal 
and that in order to explore their individual and partner’s sexual 
desire and help build their way to feeling desire personalisation of 
both digital and tangible technology was key. P4: "Everybody has 
a diferent idea of what they fnd sexually attractive or something 
they like to do." They agreed that personalised preferences should 
be based on information about their sex life, and things they (do 
not) want from the technology. Ideas from participants included 
technology that facilitated a level of control for users to amend 
what topics it raised and the level of adventurousness it shared, 
how invasive the product should be, and types of content it would 
share. Participants explained that a product that could suggest 
content based on individual preferences would give them a space 
to explore topics themselves that they perhaps would not explore 
with their partner. In this way, participants could explore their own 
sexual desire then choose what to share with their partner. However, 
participants wanted to keep a certain level of spontaneity, as they 
still wanted to be surprised by content, interactions or stimuli they 
had not thought of themselves. Therefore, they thought there should 
be a balance so there was still space for surprise and inspiration. 
Additionally, participants highlighted the importance of ongoing 
refnement of personalisation, as they predicted changes in their 
sexual or relational behaviour, and ebbs and fows in their desire 
which technologies should take into account. Examples they dis-
cussed were the ability to change settings easily and reviewing 
users’ sexual desire and experiences of content so that the prod-
uct could learn and provide fne-grained suggestions or change 
its content. This way, the product could ’grow’ with the user, as 
participants thought that users might want to explore other things 
after a while. P4: "If you decline all the time, maybe that should au-
tomatically change in your preferences or something. That you can 
stay in contact with your app about that it works the way you like it. " In most ideas on personalisation to help them explore, partici-
pants mentioned apps as they could enable a high level of person-
alisation, fexibility and expansion of content. 
5.2.5 Promoting desire should not become another "to-do". Stress 
and symptoms of depression and low mood were often mentioned 
by participants as barriers towards being open to feeling sexual 
desire and making an efort. All participants would like technology 
to help them make this efort but were also concerned that using 
a future product to enhance sexual desire would become "another 
thing to do on the list" and still pose a barrier. In this, participants 
expressed the need for concrete, small and practical chunks of 
information to be able to implement in daily life straight away and 
experience small successes. P2: "I think it has to be short, with the 
questions and challenges. So you can really implement it in daily life 
without it taking too much time. ". Additionally, they explained that 
diferent moods require diferent approaches to getting to feel desire 
and that it would support them if technologies provided contextual 
information such as suitability of the product, or recommendations 
on interactions or content, for diferent moods, and places. Most 
participants did not want sex or sexual desire to be quantifed, 
specifcally planned or goal-related (’another thing to do’), to avoid 
making it feel like a task or performance-related leading to further 
stress. 
Aside from small implementable interactions, a few participants 
also highlighted the value of gamifcation in the process of enliven-
ing their sexual desires. Some ideas included the use of scores or 
penalty points, which would work as an incentive to push peo-
ples’ behaviour and their boundaries within a light and playful 
perspective. 
In terms of the type of technology, participants argued that 
interactions with an app on a smartphone would be easiest to incor-
porate in daily life since their smartphones are always around and 
to hand. Participants liked the thought of tangible physical products 
encountered naturally in their environment and being surprised 
by their partner through bodily senses. They however also argued 
it did not address the mental aspect of sexual desire much (and 
therefore less helpful in supporting lower desire in the long term). 
They also mentioned that there could have difculty using it as 
they would need to actively think about using it, which was un-
derlined by many participants as they explained hiding sex-related 
objects in their house and forgetting about it. A few participants 
raised ideas that combined tangible products with an app where the 
tangible product would be an extension of communication, or part 
of challenges in the app. Participants highlighted the benefts of 
apps to nudge them, while the related tangible products that focus 
more on sensory experiences, could help reinforce the experience 
or interaction provided by the app by bringing participants in the 
moment through the sensory experiences. This combination would 
also allow for fexibility in using the tangible product with(out) the 
app and using it individually or together. 
6 DISCUSSION: RE-IMAGINING TECHNOLOGY 
FOR SEXUAL DESIRE 
Sexuality, intimacy and desire are very personal topics and they ebb 
and fow for individuals and within relationships. While sexuality 
in HCI research [48] and sex-tech [26] are on the rise, there is much 
1852DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA van Greevenbroek et al. 
space to explore sexual desire within intimate relationships. In this 
paper, we aimed to study how cohabiting millennials can leverage 
technology to support exploration, evocation and maintenance of 
sexual desire, and be an enabler rather than a barrier. To this end, 
we ran two studies. Findings from the frst, online survey, showed 
that participants struggled with spending time and efort to create 
a space for sexual desire, and many felt the need to increase it. The 
main themes from the second interview study were: (1) Keeping 
in step with a changing other, (2) Creating a space for "us" to feel 
desire, (3) Exploring desire playfully without shame, (4) Promoting 
exploration and developing sexual wellness knowledge (5) Avoiding 
the need for promoting desire becoming another "to-do". Here we 
discuss the main insights and their implications for HCI research 
and design. 
6.1 Promoting authentic desire in a couple 
Previous research indicates the need for couples to engage in novel 
experiences to see each other diferently, which can evoke feelings 
of attractiveness and growth, and with this, sexual desire [32, 63]. 
Suggestions from previous work have focused on creating novel 
ways for sexual expression and feeling intimacy, pleasure or tactile 
stimulation [6, 29, 49, 116], emphasising on bodily experiences; 
there has been interest in designing for long distance relationships 
[93, 116]. Our results suggest that there is potential for technol-
ogy to leverage these ways of supporting and rekindling desire in 
cohabiting couples. Our fndings suggested providing options to 
send users spontaneous prompts to create opportunities for new 
experiences (individually, together or enable users to surprise each 
other). Participants expressed the need for surprise and playful 
novel technology experiences that provided spontaneous prompts, 
which could help to maintain desire when they lacked novelty or 
felt stuck for inspiration, resonating with Murray et al. [77]. Our 
fndings show that surprises may also be provoked by the content 
itself and suggest that content in technology should be explicit, 
playful, inventive and explore boundaries. Some of these character-
istics have been identifed in previous literature such as [12, 29] and 
in the present work we extend these by providing ideas and users’ 
perspectives on how this can be achieved. In fact, in the future to 
encourage playful interactions within couples, these characteristics 
could go beyond content and may be embedded in a larger system of 
interconnected interactions that couples can build on in individual 
ways. 
Our study results often speak to the needs stated by participants 
to explore, increase or maintain desire but equally, participants felt 
that they did not always feel desire equally to their partners. Not 
only that, but participants wanted to express their own needs so the 
couple could engage with each other by communicating their own 
desire whilst understanding their partner’s level of desire and what 
they wanted or did not want from their sex life as a couple. Thus, 
technology could also be a facilitator of understanding diferences 
in desire (and what was considered "desirable" or "sexy" for each 
individual in the relationship, as this can difer). 
Furthermore, fndings suggest that spontaneous prompts with 
accomplishable steps could be valuable in promoting people to cre-
ate experiences or make an efort by providing immediacy and a low 
threshold. Earlier research has already shown that notifcations and prompts with small steps can guide behavioural change and reduce 
habitual behaviour [ 34, 87], though this has not been researched in 
the context of sexual behaviour. Future research needs to explore 
the acceptability and confguration of this in a sexual context. 
6.2 Creating a dedicated space for desire 
The results of this study show that technology should focus on 
providing space for desire to emerge, supporting intimate commu-
nication and erotic life activities, which confrms the suggestions of 
Bertselsen (2007) [12]. To efectively provide this space for sexual 
desire of couples, our results suggest design should take both the 
personal needs of an individual as well as the needs of a couple 
into account. It should enable opportunities to explore desires as a 
couple and individually, as well as support couples’ communication. 
For example, participants spoke about fnding ways to communi-
cate desire and lust to their partner at a distance without being able 
to act as key in prepping space for desire, which could be achieved 
by using remote technologies such as smart speakers to speak at a 
distance or other Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to control 
and create playful communication or sensory experiences by con-
trolling the environment (such as using an app to control lights to 
set the mood). 
Participants in this study referred to diferent sensory stimuli trig-
gering sexual desire and were hesitant on interacting with screens 
during sexual activities. In this, novel technologies with diferent 
sensory modalities could provide ways to introduce diferent smells 
or sounds into the ambient environment to provide excitement (for 
example, by reproducing memories of pleasurable past experiences) 
[83, 100]. 
In line with earlier research [69, 89, 97, 111], the current study 
shows that technology distracts people from being intimate, but 
indicates that people want to minimise this. One suggestion to 
overcome this is to provide a separate space for sexual desire in 
technology, where distracting sensory stimuli that could stife desire 
are blocked during the use of the technology (such as incoming no-
tifcations and messages). Pro-active blocking software (blocking all 
incoming messages and notifcations automatically in specifc con-
texts) has shown positive results in reducing distractions [51]. How-
ever, it is suggested that this software should be semi-automated, 
giving users the fnal responsibility [51]. 
The aesthetics of a digital interface have a large impact on emo-
tion [14] and (perceived) usability [101]. Findings suggest using 
illustrations, bright and warm colours or dark and sensual colours. 
Our results suggest providing a minimal, straightforward user in-
terface that establishes an emotional space and looks approachable 
by communicating sexual desire as part of everyday life, resonating 
with earlier research [29]. 
6.3 Mitigating shame and encouraging 
engagement 
Findings suggest that, in order to use technology for sexual desire, 
shame needs to be mitigated. Earlier research shows the impor-
tance of overcoming shame to talk and explore sexual desire [42]. 
There has been previous research about sexuality in HCI around 
decreasing shame mostly around pornography, sex toys, or female 
genitalia [6, 49, 52]. Our work suggests how technology could be 
1853Exploring Sexual Desire DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
used to mitigate shame in initiating sex with a partner and sharing 
individual desires and needs. Our fndings show that participants 
wanted to normalise feelings of sexual desire but hesitated to ex-
press desire because they were unsure of their partner’s reaction, 
which resonates with earlier fndings [22, 43]. One way that our 
participants felt that technology can match partners’ preferences 
and send spontaneous prompts to help people overcome this feeling 
of shame to initiate new topics in conversations or activities, as it 
removes the responsibility of choosing. The results also suggest 
that technology could mitigate shame by providing normalising 
communication, stories of other people, and afrming transparent 
information. This has also been found valuable in mitigating shame 
around sex in earlier research [42]. 
In addition, the current study found that technology could help 
bridge the gap in desire discrepancies, resulting from the variability 
and uniqueness of sexual desire of both partners individually, by 
matching the personalised preferences of individuals in a relation-
ship and providing suggestions to mitigate this gap. 
Findings also highlighted the importance of trust in technology, 
in particular in secured privacy, to enable carefree use and explo-
ration of sexual desire using technology. This is an important aspect, 
as services exist that use data from smart sex toys, smartphones, 
and mobile social networks to analyse (objective) human sexual 
behaviour, for example in China [117]. With the rise of technol-
ogy for sex where intimate data is used in algorithm for product 
improvement, we need to be conscious of the risk of ’datafed’ in-
timacy and pleasure and dictating what is a ’healthy’ or ’good’ 
sexlife [33]. In addition, much smart sex-tech is not well protected, 
which increases the risk on remote sexual assault [114]. Our results 
suggest this could be provided by protecting access to technology 
and providing discrete notifcations. Also, options should be pro-
vided to use technology anonymously and store and use data only 
locally. However, this could be a barrier to designing IoT for sexual 
desire. New developments in data and privacy protection using 
blockchain technology could provide a secure way to store users’ 
data in the future [ 39] and ofer space for IoT technologies to sup-
port sexual desire. However, in the design of intimate technologies, 
it must also be remembered that the potential for harm can be very 
real with instances of tech-abuse on the rise, such as use of IoT 
or connected technologies for gaslighting and harming intimate 
partners[ 57]. Thus technology designers must take every care in 
designing remotely controlled intimate devices. 
Our results indicate that personalisation could support cognitive 
planning by suggesting content that helps build up or explore sex-
ual desire by, for example, providing options to indicate preferences 
on topics. Our users mentioned personalised recommendations and 
Artifcial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ML) applications could 
be implemented to recommend relevant, specifc and inspiring con-
tent for users [90]. However, a signifcant downside is that this 
system assumes a user always wants the same [ 46], while individ-
uals’ and their partners’ sexual desire can change. Besides, it is 
important to consider how people would feel and be transparent 
about the implications of AI/ML constantly collecting their personal 
intimate data if such systems are used. Earlier research highlights 
the importance of users’ autonomy to control and defne their use 
of technology was also mentioned in earlier research [29, 41]. It 
was however unclear how users would want this, operate this or need this more specifcally - what does this look like? Our fnd-
ings fll this gap and suggest that it is important that technology 
provides options to personalise and adapt and grow along with 
peoples’ fuctuating sexual desire. Our fndings also suggest that 
in order to retain novelty and surprise, technology for sexual de-
sire should provide options for personalisation but not constantly 
personalise and provide selections for individuals and couples to 
explore themselves. 
6.4 The tension of control 
Whilst participants wanted spontaneity, they also felt that desire 
is something they should work on and thus control. Our fndings 
imply that technology could provide spontaneity, while users felt 
they are making an efort for their sex life by using the technology. 
However, users also felt that spontaneity/prompts should be well 
balanced with user control (e.g., the timing of these prompts) and 
users should be able to temporarily block other notifcations to 
minimise distractions when they need to be present. Thus, there is 
a need for balance between spontaneity and control. 
Creating space for desire in a couple’s life with technology has 
important implications. What is the role of technology? Is it a fa-
cilitator and mediator or is it in the role of a participant? Most of 
our participants saw it as a facilitator though other roles have been 
discussed in the literature [27]. Our participants wanted to endow 
technology with control, something that told them what to do and 
hence gave them permission to explore outside their comfort zones. 
However, the implications of shifting power from people to technol-
ogy warrant some thought. Some participants’ ideas implied that 
the technology should take the initiative, would invite (or even tell) 
the couple to try things. This is an interesting proposition as the 
responsibility of bringing “variety, surprise and playfulness” is lo-
cated in the technology, which rather than supporting sexual desire 
now becomes responsible for generating it. This “technology as an 
enabler of unplanned and unexpected encounters” is an intriguing 
path, and insights from participants not wanting to control their 
own initiation of sex encounters ties to the need of some people to 
be given permission and be invited to explore. 
This also brings up the issue of consent. In addition to consent 
between partners, using technology for aspects of sexual activity 
needs to consider technology-mediated consent. Each can be in the 
role of victim of non-consensual activities by the other (e.g., feeling 
coerced to participate) or the perpetrator (e.g., making another par-
ticipate in unwanted activity). The literature describes consensual 
as well as non-consensual sexual interactions using technology 
(e.g., [118]). Even adopting such technologies at one point in time, 
does not mean ongoing consent and many technologies have been 
previously criticised for failing to design for the possibility that 
a person may change their mind about sex-related activities and 
want to stop the experience. 
When ofering behavioural change related, persuasive and in-
teractive technology, the risk of emotional manipulation and, in 
worse cases, abuse or violence, the role of mutual consent needs 
to be acknowledged and ideally built-in into the technology [98]. 
This was not explicitly highlighted by participants of this study, 
though they mentioned to base prompts on their and their part-
ners’ overlapping preferences which does not account for ongoing 
1854DIS ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA van Greevenbroek et al. 
dialogue that consent should be [98]. Though Strengers et al. (2021) 
already suggested requirements to implement this in diferent tech-
nologies [98], future research is needed to understand how consent 
would work best when designing for sexual desire, balancing the 
value of spontaneity and surprise with establishing ongoing explicit 
consent. 
This also brings up the role of the designer in creating such tech-
nologies. Participants often highlighted ideas, e.g., around dressing 
“to feel attractive” or preparing for a date “by buying something”. 
This can arguably be seen as producing technology that could po-
tentially feed stereotypes and consumerism. In refecting on our 
role as the designer in this situation, we feel conficted in ofering 
the option to the user versus what our own values might be. In 
retrospect, foregrounding values in these design tasks could have 
provided opportunities for users to refect if they were considering 
their values with respect to the task and enhance the awareness of 
these values by participants during design activity. Existing meth-
ods or frameworks such as value-sensitive design do attempt to 
engage with values and can be leveraged for this but their sup-
port of activities such as value discovery and awareness are often 
contingent on designers’ own refective ability [35]. 
6.5 Limitations 
This study did have many limitations. Our recruitment strategy, 
which led to almost only heterosexual, monogamous participants 
and few gay (3), lesbian, bisexual and polyamorous people (1). Thus, 
we were unable to explore whether people in diferent relationships 
have distinct requirements for technology. However, it could also 
be due to the fact that we may have insufciently accounted for 
LGBTQ+ and polyamorous inclusive questions in our survey, result-
ing in unintended exclusion. Future research should mitigate this 
[92], and should target recruitment of these groups by approaching 
diferent communities outside researchers’ own bubble, which was 
assumed to be diverse. Because of this limitation, it is unknown 
how these design implications ft LGBTQ+ people. Future research 
should focus on co-investigating with LGTBQ+ people. We also did 
not focus on asexual individuals (not to be confused with aroman-
tic) who can be members of millennial couples, and sometimes they 
are in couples with people who are not asexual, sometimes even 
engaging in certain sexual/intimate practices and with fuctuating 
and varied levels of sexual desire. Including diverse groups is essen-
tial to any big picture of designing for sexual desire and should be 
included in future work. We focused on millenials, though we want 
to research if requirements can be extended to other age groups, 
such as the sexual desire of older adults, which are often consid-
ered asexual [50]. As the research is conducted in Western Europe 
(specifcally the UK and the Netherlands), it is unknown whether 
the design implications identifed in this study also resonate with 
people from other cultures as sex can be highly subjective to culture 
[1]. 
7 CONCLUSION 
This study explored how technology can support sexual desire 
in cohabiting millennial couples. A survey and interviews with 
participatory sketching activities identifed feelings, needs and re-
quirements. Sketches derived from these interviews were evaluated to validate and deepen insights. Findings showed people wanted 
to use technology to support evolving needs, creating space and 
exploring desire together, mitigating shame and promoting play-
fulness, exploring sexual knowledge and to mitigate sexual desire 
feeling like an activity. Based on the fndings, we discussed design 
principles on how future technology could play an important role 
and be situated within the comfort of users’ private space to sup-
port sexual desire. Studies such as this are important to explore 
what people need from technologies as it may not always be more 
advanced technology but uncovering potential patterns and interac-
tions, and ways to use them in their personal lives in an innovative 
way. Our research is the frst in (1) providing insights in which 
areas related to sexual desire, technologies could help overcome dif-
fculties, and (2) providing specifc design considerations to design 
for sexual desire. 
As we focused on cohabiting millennial couples, and our sample 
was unintendedly heterosexual, future research need to be con-
ducted to evaluate whether our fndings and research methods 
can be extended to other generations and sexualities. Dedicated 
research should be conducted to explore queer individuals and their 
needs in technology to enhance sexual desire. This research was a 
frst attempt at exploring foundational principles for designing for 
sexual desire. Future research could be conducted to explore how 
these principles can be used to create innovative design solutions 
to validate whether the design principles actually ’work’ in prac-
tice, their context, and whether this elicits new needs. In this, it is 
important to gain more understanding on how consent and privacy 
should be situated within technology for sexual desire.
