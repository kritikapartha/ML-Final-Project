ABSTRACT 
In two surveys of adults in the United States (N=723), we asked 
about perceptions of the degree to which a variety of behaviors, 
when engaged in with a sex robot or a human, would constitute 
monogamous relationship infdelity (Study 1), and also asked re-
spondents to consider monogamous partner behavior when com-
mitted with a robot that was matched to sexual partner preferences 
(Study 2). Study 1 revealed that acts committed with sex robots 
were considered less severe and less likely to be judged as infdelity 
as those same acts committed with another human. Results further 
revealed that male survey respondents rated all partner behaviors 
with sex robots as less likely to constitute cheating behavior than 
their female counterparts. This fnding may be explained by the 
portrayal of sex robots as hyper-feminized female sexual partners 
for men, both in the way these technologies are presented as well 
as how they are sold. However, when asked to consider a sex robot 
that was matched to males or females (Study 2), this diference 
disappeared. For all respondents, giving sex robots specifcity as 
either male or female resulted in higher ratings of partner infdelity 
as compared to Study 1. This work allows us to empirically speak to 
a common concern at the center of many debates over the societal 
implications of sex robots—potential harm to human relationships.

1.1 The Rise of Sex Robots 
Sex robots have been a part of popular fction, media, public dis-
course, and other cultural mediums for millennia. With roots in 
Ancient Roman prose, the concept of an inorganic humanoid sex 
partner precedes the etymology of the word ‘robot’ by over 2000 
years [72]. This idea took shape in the 17th century, when Dutch 
sailors sold the frst sex dolls to the Japanese during the Rangaku 
period [42, 75, 96]. As sex dolls have evolved into sex robots in 
the modern era [7, 73, 133, 141], they are receiving long overdue 
attention as a topic worthy of academic study. 
The work by Levy [75] provided an early exploration of sex 
robots and started widespread academic discourse about their de-
velopment and use. Sex robots have been defned by these scholars 
in a variety of ways and along a wide a spectrum of detail, including 
“humanoid robots that are designed for sexual use [77],” “robots 
used for having sex [9],” and “service robots that perform actions 
contributing directly towards improvement in the satisfaction of 
the sexual needs of a user [44].” Although the full realization of com-
monplace autonomous sexual partners is still in progress, Döring 
et al. [34] described that future sex robots may soon be able to 
display conversation, emotions, pre-programmable personalities, 
and autonomous behaviors such as simulating sexual movement 
and expressing orgasm. The seminal studies by Scheutz and Arnold 
[110, 111] furthered our understanding of the public’s concept of a 
sex robot by providing some of the frst data driven investigations 
in surveys of perceived capabilities, acceptable uses and forms, as 
well as their advantages and disadvantages. 
1.2 Do Sex Robots Cause Harm? 
Although sex robots are receiving more academic attention, and the 
number of empirical studies of sex robots has been growing steadily 
[30, 38, 39, 70, 78, 87, 93, 102, 121, 124, 125, 129], the majority of 
scholarly work on sex robots remains theoretical. The bulk of this 
work consists of spirited debate garnering both support for [26, 
31, 44, 62, 77] and strong criticism against sex robot development 
and use [24, 103, 104]. Recent position papers have focused on 
potential positive use cases for sex robots [9, 23], especially for 
health and sexual care [12, 21, 32, 44, 63, 69]. Many others have 
focused on strongly debating the merits of regulating or banning 
sex robots all together [8, 26, 31, 66, 104]. Furthermore, drawing on 
experience from studies of feminist theory, prostitution and gender 
and sex-based inequity [56, 104], as well as human relationship 
dynamics, ethics, and consent [41, 45, 76, 94, 95, 97, 119] researchers 
have made many reasonable arguments cautioning against the 
societal implications of the proliferation of sex robots. However, 
truly autonomous sex robots have yet to be created, and the majority 
of cautionary claims about sex robots remain speculative [11, 13, 
22, 25, 26].

129Central to many debates are claims that sex robots will pose great 
risk [46] especially to human-human relationships. Such claims 
include, that people who use sex robots for sexual or emotional 
companionship may no longer seek human partners [122], that the 
prolifc and prolonged use of sex robots will diminish individual 
and societal aptitude for empathy and compassion [47, 57, 103], 
that drawing parallels between sex robot use and sex work will 
exacerbate existing gender-based power inequities (for instance, 
between human sex workers and human sex clients [104]), or that 
existing relationships with human partners will be harmed or di-
minished by the introduction of sex robots in some meaningful way 
[36]. 
As much as potentially harmful implications for human relation-
ships have remained a prevailing cautionary claim surrounding 
sex robots, no studies to date have directly explored the means by 
which sex robots could bring harm to a human relationship—as 
extradyadic actors of infdelity in monogamous relationships, for 
instance—or explored perceptions of sex with robots when set in 
context of existing human relationship dynamics. Thus, we ask the 
question, can a person commit relationship infdelity with a sex 
robot? And if so under what conditions? An exploration of these 
questions would be necessary to better understand the potential 
risk(s) to human relationships sex robots may pose, and as a result, 
ofer empirical evidence to theoretical cautions related to their use. 
1.3 Technology as an Infdelity Facilitator 
The formation of monogamous relationships is considered the norm 
in the U.S., with 90% of young people marrying at least once in their 
lifetime [15]. Despite this norm, many people engage in infdelity 
[126]and infdelity accounts for 20%-40% of divorces among the
U.S. population [84] with men viewing monogamy as more sacri-
fcial than women [37, 112]. Men and women also difer in their
perceptions of breaches of monogamy. Sexual infdelity was found
to be more distressing for men while emotional infdelity was more
distressing for women [137].
The number of related research studies on perceptions of inf-
delity committed in the technological sphere, including via social 
media, cybersex, and written digital communications like email, 
text, and chatrooms, have been growing quickly [1, 33, 54, 60, 113, 
134]. Social media and written digital communication have been 
the main focus thus far, where fndings suggest that sexual and 
emotional online infdelity are equally distressing to both men and 
women [ 59]. Regarding cybersex, research has also suggested that 
many individuals do not consider this form of sex to be infdelity 
due to a lack of physical contact between parties [20]. 
However, the current state of the literature has yet to examine 
infdelity related to the use of a number of quickly developing tech-
nological mediums which can simulate, transmit, or stimulate phys-
ical contact for users [4, 51, 67] (e.g., virtual reality, bio-inspired 
robotics, soft robotics, haptic wearable interfaces). The embodi-
ment of sex robots in particular, and especially when coupled with 
advances in soft robotics [2, 5, 78], can add realism to physical 
contact in ways that cybersex and other forms of digital commu-
nications cannot. Further, sex robots provide not only the ability 
to simulate or replace sexual partners (i.e., sex with a robot), they
have the potential to serve as surrogates for human sexual partners Table 1: Perceptions of Dating Infdelity Scale (PDIS) instruc-
tions and behaviors to rate.

through technologically-mediate sex (i.e., sex via a robot). Robot-
mediated sex would allow individuals to engage in intercourse 
through devices controlled remotely, over the internet, in real time, 
and with feedback for how partners express themselves (see tele-
and cyber-dildonics for analogous examples [55, 69, 79, 80]). Sex 
robot embodiment therefore afords opportunity to cross a “physi-
cal divide” that remains in place with other technological mediums. 
Thus, acts committed with a sex robot (or via a sex robot) may 
have the potential to be more strongly considered violations of 
monogamy than other technology-enabled acts and interactions. 
1.4 Overview and Contributions 
To address these questions, in two studies, we investigated sex robot 
use in the context of predominant human relationship dynamics— 
specifcally monogamous relationships—and whether sex robots 
would be considered extradyadic actors of infdelity in those rela-
tionships. In Study 1, we compared perceptions of monogamous 
partner behaviors when committed with a sex robot to behaviors 
committed with another human. Doing so provides a benchmark by 
which to compare the perceived severity of extradyadic acts com-
mitted with a sex robot to those same acts committed with other 
humans. We also examined diferences in the degree to which those 
behaviors were considered infdelity by male and female survey 
respondents. Building on these fndings, in Study 2 we examined 
whether perceptions of infdelity with a robot could be further in-
fuenced by asking respondents to consider their partner engaging 
in behaviors with a sex robot that was described as specifcally 
male or female. We have revealed that for many people, sex robots 
as a concept may be infuenced by a bias in representation of sex 
robots, or be vague and underspecifed, and when provided with 
more specifcity, attitudes towards this concept can be powerfully 
changed. The results of both studies speak to a specifc caution 
which commonly resides at the center of debates about the societal 
implications of sex robots, potentially harmful impact to human-
human relationships, which was previously only speculative.

2 STUDY 1 
Study 1 was developed to empirically address the question; can a 
person commit relationship infdelity with a sex robot? We aimed 
to answer this question by surveying adults in the United States on 
their perceptions of behaviors committed with a sex robot. Specif-
ically, we asked respondents to consider several diferent types 
of behaviors in which a monogamous partner might engage, and 
then judge the degree to which those behaviors would constitute 
infdelity (i.e., cheating in the relationship) when committed with 
another human and with a sex robot. We then compared percep-
tions of partner cheating with humans to perceptions of partner 
cheating with sex robots, and examined the diferences in these 
perceptions between male and female survey respondents. 
2.1 Method 
2.1.1 Survey respondents. Four hundred and ffty-two people en-
tered the study via an anonymous link posted to the crowdsourcing 
platform, Prolifc (www.prolifc.co). Prolifc was chosen because 
recent publications have pointed to a signifcant decline in the 
quality of crowdsourced data obtained from Amazon’s Mechanical 
Turk (MTurk) [18, 65]. For data screening, we applied the following 
criteria to be included in analyses: Respondents needed to fully 
complete the study’s survey measures, identify their biological sex 
as either male or female, give a response to an item asking about 
sexual orientation, and provide correct answers to attention check 
items inserted into our measures. After applying these criteria, data 
from 88 respondents were removed from our sample. The remaining 
sample used for analyses consisted of data from 364 respondents, 
165 males (45.3%) and 199 females (54.7%), with ages ranging from 
18-74 years (M = 30.65 years, SD = 10.98). One hundred and seventy-
nine (49.2%) respondents reported their relationship status as single, 
86 (23.6%) as married, and 99 (27.2%) in a relationship. Two hundred and eighty-two (77.5%) respondents reported their 
sexual orientation as heterosexual, 56 (15.4%) as bisexual, and 26 
(7.1%) as homosexual. As of 2017, 4.5% of the U.S. population iden-
tifed as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender [92]. The Study 1 
sample is likely over representative of individuals who identify as 
gay, lesbian, or bisexual in the U.S. 
Ninety-seven respondents claimed to have experienced infdelity 
(26.7%), 210 respondents claimed to have not experienced infdelity 
(57.7%), and 55 (15.1%) claimed to possibly have experienced inf-
delity by a past or current partner. Sixty-nine respondents (19.0%) 
claimed to have committed infdelity in a relationship, 286 (78.6%) 
respondents claimed to have not committed infdelity in a rela-
tionship, and seven respondents (1.9%) reported they may have 
committed infdelity during a relationship. One 40-year-old male 
respondent claimed to have used a sex robot and seven respondents 
claimed to have known someone who used a sex robot. 
2.1.2 Survey measures. Survey respondents were frst asked to 
provide responses to several biographical data questions (e.g., age, 
biological sex, sexual orientation, relationship status, and native 
language), as well as report whether they had experienced or com-
mitted relationship infdelity in a current or past monogamous 
relationship, and whether they had ever used a sex robot or knew 
anyone else who had used a sex robot. For this research, we re-
frained from providing participants with a specifc defnition or 
description of a sex robot due to the myriad of ways in which sex 
robots have been defned in the literature, and the wide spectrum 
of possibilities that could be considered part of the category of “sex 
robot.” As an alternative, we assessed what respondents considered 
sex robots to be by following the work by Scheutz and Arnold [110] 
and asking what person-like qualities are associated with sex robots. 
Specifcally, survey respondents were presented with 15 potential 
capabilities of sex robots and then asked to afrm whether or not

prompt, “I envision a sex robot is capable of (select all that apply).” 
The list of sex robot capabilities is provided in Table 2. 
Respondents completed the Perceptions of Dating Infdelity Scale 
(PDIS) [138] twice by making judgments about two scenarios: a 
monogamous partner committing behaviors with another human 
(i.e., “Please consider if your partner were to behave with another 
person in the following ways while in a monogamous relationship 
with you”), as well as with a sex robot (i.e., “Please consider if your 
partner were to behave with a sex robot in the following ways 
while in a monogamous relationship with you.”) The PDIS consists 
of 12 items representing a range of extradyadic behaviors, classifed 
as ambiguous, deceptive, or explicit. Ambiguous behaviors may 
or may not constitute infdelity, deceptive behaviors involve lying 
about or withholding information, and explicit behaviors are overtly 
sexual or romantic. Respondents rated the degree to which they 
considered each of the PDIS behaviors to be cheating using the 
following 5-point Likert-type scale: 1=“Defnitely not,” 2=“Probably 
not,” 3=“Might or might not,” 4=“Probably yes,” or 5=“Absolutely.” 
Table 1 provides a list of all behaviors included in the PDIS. 
2.1.3 Procedure. The study was prepared using the online research 
platform, Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Respondents entered the 
study through an anonymous link posted on Prolifc. After read-
ing the informed consent information, respondents indicated their 
agreement to participate by clicking “next” at the end of the in-
formed consent page. Then, respondents were asked to fll out 
the biographical information questions, followed by the sex robot 
capability items, then both versions of the PDIS. The order of presen-
tation of the PDIS measures was randomized and counterbalanced 
across respondents. Among the survey items, 12 “attention check” 
items were randomly intermixed to screen data for potentially care-
less responses. These included items like asking respondents to 
select a specifc response, e.g., “Please select ‘Probably not’ for this 
item.” Once respondents completed all measures, they were asked to leave feedback for our research team and provided with a study 
completion code to receive payment. The study took approximately 
20 minutes to complete and respondents were compensated $3.17 
($9.51 per hour) in return for the participation. All study materi-
als were reviewed and approved by George Mason University’s 
institutional review board. 
2.2 Study 1 Results 
The data were submitted to a Greenhouse-Geisser corrected 3x2x2 
repeated measures ANOVA with Behavior Type (ambiguous, decep-
tive, explicit) and Partner Type (human, robot) as within- subjects 
variables and Respondent Sex (male, female) as a between-subjects 
variable. Results showed that there was a statistically signifcant 
main efect for Behavior Type. Across partner types, there were 
statistically signifcant diferences in whether respondents rated 
explicit ( = 3.82,  = 0.04), deceptive ( = 3.64,  = 0.05) 
and ambiguous behaviors ( = 2.09,  = 0.04),  (1.85, 669.27) = 
981.60,  < .001, p2 = 0.73 as likely to constitute infdelity. 
There was a statistically signifcant main efect for Partner Type 
as well. Respondents rated engaging in behaviors with robot part-
ners as much lower on the infdelity scale ( = 2.78,  = 0.06) 
than human partners ( = 3.58,  = 0.03),  (1, 362) = 257.25,  < 
.001, p2 = 0.63 across all behavior types. 
Importantly, there was also a statistically signifcant interac-
tion between Behavior Type and Partner Type  (1.88, 680.55) = 
263.60,  < .001, p2 = 0.42, where respondents gave diferent pat-
terns of infdelity ratings to robots than they did to humans. For 
humans, as behavioral transgressions became more severe (i.e., 
ambiguous followed by deceptive and then explicit), ratings of in-
fdelity correspondingly increased in a linear fashion,  (1, 362) = 
2776.25,  < .001, p2 = 0.89. For robots, however, a diferent pattern 
emerged. Infdelity ratings increased from ambiguous behaviors 
( = 2.08,  = 0.05) to deceptive behaviors ( = 3.25,  = 
0.07),  < .001, but dropped for explicit behaviors ( = 3.02,  = 
0.07),  < .001. 
Session 3: Perception
HRI ’21, March 8–11, 2021, Boulder, CO, USA 
132There was also a Partner Type x Respondent Sex interaction, 
 (1, 362) = 11.86,  = .001, 2 = 0.03. Across all behaviors commit-p
ted with humans, female respondents gave higher ratings of inf-
delity than male respondents (Δ = 0.13,  = 0.04),  (1, 362) = 
4.15,  < .05, , p2 = 0.01 (see Figure 1a). However, across all be-
haviors committed with robots, the discrepancy between female 
and male respondents in infdelity ratings was more pronounced 
(Δ = 0.47,  = 0.08,  (1, 362) = 17.48,  < .001, 2 = 0.05) than 
the discrepancy between male and female respondents’ ratings of 
behaviors committed with humans (see Figure 1b). p 
2.3 Study 1 Discussion 
For human partners, the linear increase in ratings of infdelity be-
haviors from ambiguous to deceptive to explicit replicates previous 
work with the PDIS [86, 90, 106]. Additionally, sex diferences in 
perceptions of infdelity with a human partner followed previously 
established patterns, with males tending to judge PDIS behaviors as 
less likely to constitute cheating than females [71, 90, 117, 126, 138]. 
It is important to note, however, that this diference was small and 
that other research has shown evidence of comparable ratings be-
tween the sexes when judging perceptions of infdelity, especially 
when using continuous scales like the PDIS [14, 40, 52, 81]. 
Crucially, infdelity judgments with sex robots were much lower 
than infdelity judgments with humans. The appreciably large dif-
ferences in ratings between explicit acts committed with humans 
as opposed to robots further underscores this point. Thus, based on 
these data, it may be that concerns about sex robots posing a risk 
to human-human relationships, especially as actors of infdelity, 
are overstated [70]. 
The fnding that male respondents rated perceptions of infdelity 
with a robot lower than females supports previous work which has 
demonstrated a small but consistent efect of males perceiving sex 
robots more favorably than females [93, 110, 111]. Even so, this 
observed gap may be due to the pervasive and consistent bias in 
the representation of sex robots. Across all types of media and 
marketing, the dominant portrayal of sex robots is overwhelmingly 
focused on heteronormative conventions depicting human male 
partners with humanoid female sex robots [3, 9, 35, 100, 135]. Rarely 
are similar depictions of male sex robots given even though they 
exist. Additionally, the appearance of a sex robot is most often an 
adult woman with amplifed and eroticized secondary sex char-
acteristics, such as large breasts and an idyllic waist-to-hip ratio 
[49, 105], and recent work has revealed that males perceive such 
sex robots as equally attractive as human females [125]. 
By asking survey respondents to consider cheating behaviors 
conducted with a “sex robot” in a general sense, we may have 
inadvertently tapped into this bias of representation or primed re-
spondent thinking about common sex robot conventions. Doing so 
may have resulted in diferent judgements by men and women be-
cause the stereotypical depiction of the hyper-feminized sex robot 
was simply more available to both [130]. Females may have more 
readily activated a specifc representation of a sex robot engaged 
in extradyadic behaviors with their male partners, and judged be-
haviors more harshly accordingly. Males by contrast may not have 
imagined their female partners with a male sex robot but perhaps with a female sex robot or some non-specifc notion of a sex ro-
bot and consequently lowered their infdelity ratings. It is possible 
that sex diferences disappear if representations of a sex robot are 
presented in a more relevant manner to individuals. Study 2 was 
designed to test this hypothesis. 
3 STUDY 2 
In Study 2, we sought to examine how perceptions of infdelity with 
a sex robot might be impacted by asking respondents to consider the 
use of sex robots with specifc biological forms, as opposed to sex 
robot use in a general sense. To do this, we made a straightforward 
change to our survey design. Instead of asking respondents to 
consider a monogamous partner’s behavior with an unspecifed sex 
robot, we asked them to consider a monogamous partner’s behavior 
with a male or female sex robot. Specifcally, we matched the sex of 
the robot to the inferred sexual partner preference (male or female) 
of the respondent’s monogamous partner, to heighten the salience 
of the robot as a relationship rival. We predicted that by doing so, 
sex diferences in perceptions of these behaviors as violations to 
their monogamous relationships would disappear. 
3.1 Method 
3.1.1 Survey respondents. For Study 2, 373 new respondents en-
tered the study via an anonymous link posted to Prolifc. We ap-
plied the same criteria for data inclusion as Study 1. After screening 
we were left with data from 359 respondents for further analyses. 
These included 164 (45.7%) males and 195 females (54.3%) with ages 
ranging from 18 to 74 ( = 31.87,  = 10.45). One hundred and 
twenty-nine (35.9%) respondents reported their relationship status 
as single, 132 (36.8%) as married, and 98 (27.3%) in a relationship. 
Two hundred and ninety-eight (83.0%) respondents reported 
their sexual orientation as heterosexual, 54 (15.0%) as bisexual, and 
7 (1.9%) as homosexual. Again, our sample for Study 2 is likely 
over representative of individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, or 
bisexual in the U.S. Seven respondents (6 males and 1 female, ages 
25-48 years,  = 38.5 years,  = 7.21 years) claimed to have used 
a sex robot, and 11 respondents claimed to have known someone 
who used a sex robot. None of the respondents were previously 
exposed to the study. 
3.1.2 Survey measures. Similar to Study 1, respondents were asked 
to report on several demographic variables (e.g., age, biological 
sex, sexual orientation, relationship status, and native language). 
Respondents completed the sex robot capability items, then com-
pleted the PDIS, this time with a diferent manipulation than in 
Study 1. In this study, respondents’ reported biological sex and 
sexual orientation was used to infer preferences for monogamous 
sexual relationship partners. For instance, if a given respondent 
reported that they identifed as a heterosexual male, we inferred 
that their preference for monogamous sexual partner was female. 
From this inference, we asked him to complete the PDIS by imag-
ining his monogamous partner engaged in behaviors with a robot 
specifcally described as male. This manipulation was intended to 
match the sex robot to the inferred sexual partner preferences of 
respondents’ monogamous partners. For example, the instructions 
for completing the PDIS given to a respondent who identifed as 
a homosexual female were as follows, “Please think of a serious

committed relationship that you have had in the past, that you cur-
rently have, or that you would like to have. Consider if your partner
were to behave with a female sex robot in the following ways while
in a monogamous relationship with you.” For respondents who
identified as bisexual, we explicitly asked them to estimate their
partners’ sexual partner preference, and then matched the robot
to their given response. Respondents again rated all ambiguous,
deceptive, and explicit behaviors listed in the PDIS using the same
5-point Likert-type scale used in Study 1.
3.1.3 Procedure. Following similar procedures as Study 1, Study 2
was prepared using Qualtrics and respondents entered the study via
an anonymous link posted to Prolific. After reading the informed
consent information, respondents indicated their agreement to par-
ticipate by clicking “next” at the end of the page. Then respondents
were asked to fill out the biographical information questions and
the sex robot capability items. Biographical data were then used
to prompt respondents to complete the PDIS while considering
specific male or female sex robots. Again, among the survey items,
12 “attention check” questions were included to screen the data
for potentially careless responding. Once respondents completed
all survey measures, they were asked to leave feedback for the
research team and provided with a study completion code to re-
ceive payment for participation. The study took approximately
15 minutes to complete and respondents were compensated $3.17
($12.68/per hour). All study materials were approved by George
Mason University’s institutional review board.
3.2 Study 2 Results
To assess whether there were differences between the two study
samples, we evaluated whether responses to the sex robot capability
items differed across studies. Using Chi-Square analyses, we looked
for relationships between Respondent Sex (male, female) and Study
(1, 2) using the capabilities data (see Table 2). For each capability,
there were no significant relationships between these variables, all
𝑝′𝑠>.05.Data from Study 1 and Study 2 were then used to create a new
variable called Robot Type (unspecified, matched). From Study 1,
infidelity ratings for behaviors with the robot were used to form the
“unspecified” robot category of the variable, while the data from
Study 2 was used to form the “matched” category of the variable. A
three-way Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected ANOVA was then used to
examined the effect of Robot Type (unspecified, matched), Respon-
dent Sex (male, female) and Behavior Type (ambiguous, deceptive,
and explicit) on ratings of infidelity.
Replicating Study 1, there was a significant main effect of Be-
havior Type on ratings of whether or not behaviors constituted
infidelity,𝐹(1.85,1331.34)=616.60,𝑝<.001,𝜂2p=0.46(see Figure
2). Infidelity ratings also increased again from ambiguous behav-
iors (𝑀=2.32,𝑆𝐸=0.04) to deceptive behaviors ( 𝑀=3.52,𝑆𝐸=
0.05),𝑝<.001, but dropped again for explicit behaviors ( 𝑀=
3.22,𝑆𝐸=0.05),𝑝<.001. However, Behavior Type did not interact
with Respondent Sex, 𝐹(2,1438)=2.92,𝑝>.05,𝜂2p=0.004or Ro-
bot Type𝐹(2,1438)=2.38,𝑝>.05,𝜂2p=0.002, meaning that male
and female respondents gave similar ratings to whether behaviors
with robots constituted cheating across all behavior types.
There was, however, a significant interaction between Respon-
dent Sex and Robot Type, 𝐹(3,719)=18.10,𝑝<.001,𝜂2p=0.07. An
analysis of the simple effects showed that males increased their per-
ceptions of infidelity from an unspecified sex robot ( 𝑀=2.55,𝑆𝐸=
0.08) to a matched one ( 𝑀=3.15,𝑆𝐸=0.08),𝐹(1,719)=26.42,𝑝<
.001,𝜂2p=0.04. Similarly, females also increased perceptions of
infidelity from an unspecified sex robot ( 𝑀=3.02,𝑆𝐸=0.08) to
a matched sex robot ( 𝑀=3.36,𝑆𝐸=0.08),𝐹(1,719)=9.96,𝑝<
.01,𝜂2p=0.01. However, although female respondents rated percep-
tions of infidelity higher compared to males for an unspecified sex
robot,𝐹(1,719)=17.58,𝑝<.001,𝜂2p=0.02, the difference between
male and female respondent ratings disappeared for a matched sex
robot,𝐹(1,719)=3.30,𝑝>.05,𝜂2p=0.02. Essentially, when consid-
ering sex robots with specific forms, male respondents increased
their infidelity ratings to equal those of female respondents.
In Figure 3, we use seaborn violin plots to contrast the frequency
distributions of male and female responses to the PDIS measurescollapsed across all infdelity behavior types. Seaborn plots depict 
two diferent frequency distributions along the y-axis creating a 
wave-like efect. The fgure shows that males increased their ratings 
of infdelity for a matched robot over an unspecifed robot. Of note 
is that the distributions for the matched robot partners are more 
similar to those of the human partners than unspecifed robots. Also, 
the distributions of ratings for both types of robots (unspecifed, 
matched), have more variability compared to the ratings of humans, 
which likely refects less consensus regarding whether or not acts 
committed with sex robots constitute violations of monogamous 
relationships. 
3.3 Study 2 Discussion 
Consistent with our hypothesis, sex diferences in infdelity judg-
ments for an unspecifed robot (Study 1) were eliminated for a 
matched one (Study 2) (see Figures 2 and 3). These fndings provide 
support for our explanation that some males in Study 1 may not 
have been imagining sex robots as specifcally male when engaged 
in extradyadic behaviors with their monogamous partners. In line 
with recent research, there has been only mixed support for dif-
ferences between males and females in infdelity judgements. For 
example, one study found no sex diferences in infdelity judge-
ments for ambiguous behaviors, but not explicit behaviors [127], 
and another, by the same research team, found the opposite pattern 
[128]. Sex diferences in judgements may be highly susceptible to 
subtle methodological changes across studies. Regardless of sex, 
infdelity ratings of a matched robot increased compared to an un-
specifed robot. It is possible that some females in Study 2, like the 
males, were also able to better imagine how a sex robot would afect 
their infdelity ratings. Taken together, the results of Study 2 sug-
gest that a straightforward manipulation of matching a sex robot 
to relationship partners has strong efects on infdelity judgments 
above and beyond any sex diferences. 
4 GENERAL DISCUSSION 
In this paper we report on two studies intended to address the ques-
tion, can a person commit relationship infdelity with a sex robot? 
Because many claims about the societal implications of sex robots re-
main largely speculative [10, 17, 22, 26, 27, 50, 58, 61, 88, 94, 98, 120], 
we empirically explored one of the central concerns about sex robot 
use—harm to human-human relationships—by asking whether or 
not their use would be a violation to a monogamous relationship. 
Study 1 revealed that, compared to humans, acts committed with 
sex robots were considered much less severe and less likely to be 
judged as constituting infdelity in a monogamous relationship. 
This work for the frst time, allowed for direct comparisons to be 
made between humans and sex robots as targets of behavior that 
could bring harm to human-human relationships. However, when 
asked to consider a specifc type of sex robot (Study 2), the difer-
ences in male and female respondents’ ratings of infdelity with 
a sex robot were eliminated. Furthermore, across both male and 
female survey respondents, infdelity ratings with a matched robot 
were higher compared to an unspecifed robot, approximating the 
pattern of infdelity ratings observed with human baselines. 
Given the combined results of both studies, we posit the answer 
to the question “Can a person commit relationship infdelity with

a sex robot?” is yes, especially when sex robots are considered in 
specifc contexts with specifc partners. Furthermore, infdelity is 
harmful [37, 43]. Therefore, for now, the underlying question of 
whether sex robots can cause harm to human relationships is also 
yes. 
4.1 Mechanisms of Infdelity with Sex Robots 
Across studies, our results indicated that extradyadic behaviors 
conducted with robots were less problematic than those behav-
iors conducted with other humans. However, it is possible that 
some of our results were driven by perceptions of the current ca-
pabilities of sex robots, suggested by more afrmations of sexually 
specifc capabilities and fewer afrmations of emotional or intelli-
gent capabilities such as learning, adapting and recognizing human 
emotion. Perhaps respondents were imagining sex robot as they 
are technically feasible now, and consider them somewhere on the 
spectrum of sex tools or highly technical sex toys, as opposed to 
fully autonomous human-like fantasy playmates that rival human 
monogamous partners [64]. This conclusion is corroborated by pre-
vious work that found that people view sex with sex robots as more 
like masturbation or using a vibrator than sex with another human 
[110]. 
One hypothesis might be that with increased human-likeness 
[99], provocativeness, attractiveness as well as increases in social ca-
pabilities of sex robots, concerns over infdelity as a result of their 
use might also increase as the capabilities and features of these 
robots are enhanced and refned [107]. However, there is some evi-
dence to suggest this may not (or never will) be the case, as recent 
work has revealed that infdelity judgements for behaviors com-
mitted between humans were not afected by rival characteristics 
Session 3: Perception

135like sex, physical attractiveness, and age [128]. Additional research 
would be needed to examine if this hypothesis holds true for sex 
robots both as they exist now and as they will in the future. Future 
investigations could also examine the relative harm sex robots pose 
by comparing them to other potential “relationship threats” on 
the sex technology spectrum like internet capable sex toys (e.g., 
teledildonics), or VR pornography [79, 118, 139] and provide more 
clarity about where sex robots fall on the sex technology spectrum 
[123]. 
Across studies, respondents also rated explicit behaviors with a 
sex robot (i.e., sex) as less likely to constitute cheating than decep-
tive ones (i.e., lying about sex), in contrast to the results for humans 
which showed the opposite pattern of responses. It is possible that 
when considering the use of sex robots, it is easier to conceptual-
ize them as tools for sexual gratifcation used perhaps by one or 
more partners in a relationship. After all, sex with sex robots is a 
primary purpose of their design and use. However, when people 
consider whether their partners are lying about sex with a sex robot, 
that behavior may be seen as more problematic, perhaps because 
the motivations for lying go beyond simple sexual gratifcation. 
In contrast with the studies presented here in which we investi-
gated how one would feel about their human partners engaging in 
behaviors with a sex robot, future research could investigate the 
intriguing idea of a robot as the agent that lies to or cheats on a 
human [107]. As people are particularly attuned to detecting and 
describing human-like agency to a cheating robot [82, 116, 131], 
robot-initiated deceptive behaviors may be even more problematic 
for partners than human-initiated ones. 
4.2 Measurement of Infdelity with Sex Robots 
Perceptions of cheating behavior with sex robots may further 
change when considering the wide range of envisioned potential 
uses for sex robots, including when set in context of relationships 
[109]. We did not ask respondents if they would consider using a 
sex robot as part of their monogamous relationship, for instance. 
While sex robot companies, like Realbotix and Silicone Wives, have 
mostly sold female sex robots to male customers, they have also 
reported sales to couples not just single people [7, 19] and research 
has indicated that people might be open to sex robot use to maintain 
a relationship [110, 111], or in extreme cases even save a marriage 
[6]. Further, assessments of whether or not sex robot use would 
be considered cheating in a relationship might also be changed by 
the setting in which the use occurs, like visiting sex robot brothels 
[48, 70, 140], in therapeutic settings [39], or in extreme isolation 
environments like deep space [110]. Future work should thus assess 
whether sex robots might be considered as benefcial aids to human 
relationships and whether infdelity harm as a result of their use 
can be overcome. 
Another nuance to our measurement approach is that we ex-
amined perceptions of infdelity with imagined behaviors with sex 
robots, not actual behavior. As sex robots become more common 
and capable, future research could also evaluate participants that 
have had actual sex with robots (few participants in our studies 
reported doing so) and ask whether those experienced behaviors 
constituted infdelity, similar to how investigations of infdelity 
with humans have been conducted [37, 43]. Beyond behavioral indicators of infdelity, future research could 
also examine other markers of extradyadic attachments and their re-
lationships to infdelity. For example, Middleweek [87] investigated 
perceptions of sex robot use by analyzing online forum posts de-
scribing the specifc ways in which male owners have bonded with 
their sex dolls. Other markers of such bonding between humans 
and sex robots might include biological ones like the neuropeptitde 
oxytocin [68], which has been found to mediate bonding between 
humans and dogs [91] and between humans and virtual agents [29]. 
4.3 Limitations 
Finally, there are limitations to this work. Mean scores across sexual 
orientation types followed similar patterns, which is why all re-
spondents, regardless of reported sexual orientation, were analyzed 
together. Recognizing that prior research has revealed diferences 
in evaluations of emotional and sexual infdelity between sexual 
orientations [28, 74], and that there is almost no research on the 
implications of robotics and AI to the LGBGT+ communities [101], 
we argue that it is imperative that we continue to investigate the 
implications of sex robots on relationships to these communities. 
Further, based on our data we cannot distinguish whether some 
infdelity acts alone are more concerning than the act coupled with 
who/what the act was committed. People may have concerns about 
lying and deception in general and lying about being with a robot 
may not be as problematic as lying to relationship partners in gen-
eral. Future research could examine this by asking about lying in 
a relationship regardless of agent and perhaps varying by topic. 
We investigated these questions using a U.S. based sample, but 
these fndings should be examined cross-culturally. Our infdelity 
measurement also presented limitations. Some PDIS items may not 
have been considered relevant to sex robots (e.g. buying gifts or 
texting regularly), emotional and physical infdelity may need to 
be further distinguished, and results may change depending on 
the specifc infdelity scale used, such as the DIQ, EDBI, and the 
IES. [16, 53, 83, 85, 86, 89, 106, 108, 114, 115, 132, 136, 137]. Despite 
these limitations, this research presents the frst step to capture 
assessments of infdelity in the robotics domain. 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
In two studies, we investigated whether sex robots would be con-
sidered extradyadic actors of infdelity in monogamous human 
relationships. This work empirically informs debates around bene-
fts and risks posed by sex robots, and thus builds on theoretical 
position papers representing the bulk of published work on sex 
robots. With this work we are able to assess and quantify potential 
harm to human relationships that sex robots may pose, which was 
previously only speculative. Our work suggests it is possible to 
commit relationship infdelity with a sex robot, and as a result their 
use can pose harm to human relationships. Additionally, method-
ological care must be taken in how sex robots are described and 
asked about in future research evaluations to counter potential 
existing biases towards sex robots and infdelity reporting, which 
could mask nuances in attitudes towards and perceptions of sex 
robots.
