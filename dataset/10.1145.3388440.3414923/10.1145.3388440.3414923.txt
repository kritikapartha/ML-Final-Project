ABSTRACT
B-cell epitope prediction was first developed to help design peptide-
based vaccines for protective antibody-mediated immunity
exemplified by neutralization of biological activity (e.g., pathogen
infectivity). Requisite computational tools are benchmarked
using experimentally obtained paratope-epitope binding data, which
also serve as training data for machine-learning approaches to
development of said tools. Such data are curated in the Immune
Epitope Database (IEDB). However, IEDB curation guidelines define
B-cell epitopes primarily on the basis of paratope-bound epitope
structures, obscuring the crucial role of conformational disorder in
the underlying immune recognition process. For the present work,
pertinent IEDB B-cell assay records were retrieved and
analyzed in relation to other data from both IEDB and external
sources including the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and published
literature, with special attention to data on conformational
disorder among B-cell epitopes. This revealed examples of
antipeptide antibodies that recognize conformationally disordered
B-cell epitopes and thereby neutralize the biological activity of
cognate targets (e.g., proteins and pathogens), with inconsistency
noted in the definition of some epitopes. These results suggest an
alternative approach to curating paratope-epitope binding data
based on neutralization of biological activity by polyclonal
antipeptide antibodies, with reference to immunogenic peptide
sequences and their conformational disorder in the unbound state.

Figure 1: Representative peptidic antigen sequences
and structures thereof in unbound and paratope-bound
states. Each alignment has a header reference protein
sequence and DSSP-style secondary-structure assignments
(with ‘*’ for ‘MISSING’ residue in PDB file). Sequences
are of Enterovirus A71 VP1 capsid protein (EV71 VP1),
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 glycoprotein 41
(HIV-1 gp41) and human matrix metalloproteinase-14
(MMP14), with IEDB numbering and omitted flanking
sequences (‘...’). Secondary-structure labels are of the
form ‘ <PDB code >/<chain ID >,<binding state >’, where
‘binding state’ is either ‘unbound’ (i.e., free) or the binding-
paratope monoclonal-antibody name, with cognate peptide
immunogen sequence marked (‘ˆ’). IEDB calculated contacts
are highlighted in yellow. Immunogen sequences known
to elicit production of neutralizing polyclonal antibodies
are marked (‘+’). IEDB assay IDs (in parentheses) enable
access to pertinent assay records (via links of the form
‘https://www.iedb.org/assay/<ID>’). Structural data are from
cryo-electron microscopy (for paratope-bound EV71 VP1)
and X-ray crystallography (for all other cases).
