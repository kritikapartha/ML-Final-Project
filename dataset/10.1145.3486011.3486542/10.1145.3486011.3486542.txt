ABSTRACT
In our society, the transformations and changes in the new genera-
tions are having a great impact on the change of social organizations,
making it necessary for those responsible for the training areas to
respond to the current interests and needs of the students. In this
respect, sexuality has been a repressed area in educational contexts,
being today considered a fundamental aspect in the development
and process of learning and socializing people. Although the need
to improve educational policies in the area has been recognized,
to date it is not implemented as a strategic resource in formal ed-
ucation. On the other hand, with the advent of new technologies,
we face new ways of communicating and interacting, which inter-
feres in the sexual sphere. Aware that the sexual and technological
plane has been intertwined, it is recognized that the lack of a re-
sponsible technological culture, coupled with poor sex education,
increases the risks in cyberspace. In this context, the motivation of
this project is to generate an objective diagnosis of the current state
of sexual education in the Chilean context, followed by a proposal
for training future teachers that will promote the development of
new strategies, thus promoting the role of sexuality in schools. The
purpose of this document is to present the research plan for this
doctoral thesis and its current status. The context and motivation,
a review of the literature and the proposal for a mixed method with
a sequential exploratory design are presented. The results are ex-
pected to set the guidelines for developing a meaningful educational
proposal in teacher training.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, in Latin American contexts, social movements
have sought to politicize some spaces that have traditionally been
considered as part of the private and intimate environment, such
as sexuality. Nowadays, sexuality is a central issue in our societies
[1] and constitutes one of the essential components of human re-
lations. Sexuality is an evolutionary process that lasts a lifetime
and is intimately linked to the biological, psychological and social
development of the individual [2].
In the case of Chile, the legal framework governing sex education
is established by the General Education Law of 2009. Subsequently,
in 2010, the right to quality sex education was legitimized through
Law 20,418, which established standards on information, guidance
and benefits in this field, forcing middle schools to implement sexu-
ality programs [ 3]. Despite its regulation and implementation, this
law does not grant legal or administrative powers to effectively
safeguard the implementation of this type of education [ 4]. To date,
it hasn’t been possible to guarantee sexual education in the educa-
tional system, leaving such an educational task to the voluntary
nature of the educational centers, teachers and directives.
With the advent of new digital technologies, it is possible to
think that we are facing a new revolution, not only in our personal
relationships, but in the way we manifest our sexuality [ 2]. Sexu-
ality and technology have been intertwined, providing girls, boys,
youth and adults with different and novel sexual experiences within
the virtual environment. In this line, the new technologies have
incorporated a powerful transmitter of information on sexuality
and sexual relations [ 5], making it necessary to educate in order to
integrate and ensure the delivery of information provided by the
networks.
Faced with the complexity of sexuality, this thesis seeks to foster
and contribute toward a comprehensive, non-sexist and gender-
perspective sex education, which allows to describe, understand and
analyze how socio-cultural representations and stereotypes operate
in each social context. For this, it is necessary to start by defining
key ideas such as the concept of sex, which usually corresponds to
737TEEM’21, October 26–29, 2021, Barcelona, Spain Daniela Dinamarca Figueroa et al.
the natural from a biological plane, while the category of gender is
a social construction referring to the set of practices, social beliefs
and representations that arise in the light of a symbolism of the
difference between men and women [6].
In this context, the present study is carried out. The following
question then arises; are teachers prepared to take care of sexuality
education as required by law? Nowadays, it is known that Chilean
teachers do not have strategies to address this area. The need to
improve the quality of initial teacher training is a recurring theme
in the current national discussion on the improvement of educa-
tion [ 7], and the promulgation and implementation of curricular
programs within university institutions is required.
Viewed the lack of teacher training programs, the challenge is
assumed to carry out a study that allows to identify and respond to
current problems, social and gender-affective demands on the part
of the educational community and, overall, design a formative pro-
posal that allows the teacher to include in his educational practices.
Training in sexuality involves several challenges [ 8], representing
a current need and a complex task to face. University institutions
must rethink the design and configuration of their educational
spaces, both in-person and virtual, promoting changes oriented to
achieving a critical and appropriate sex-affective learning for new
generations.
Finally, this work is structured into five sections. The second
section describes previous works related to the concepts most im-
portant for the literature review. The third section presents the
hypothesis and main objectives of the study. The fourth section
presents the entire study methodology through the research ap-
proach and the methods needed to develop the doctoral thesis. To
conclude, the last section summarizes the main conclusions, recent
results and future steps.
2 STATE OF THE ART
2.1 Sexual Education
First, it is necessary to define what is meant by sexuality. Thus,
we will understand sexuality as the life-long expression of the
biological nature of human beings, in which psychological, affective,
emotional and social factors interact [ 9]. It is consolidated as a
fundamental aspect in human development and in the learning and
socialization process so this issue needs to be addressed in family
and educational contexts.
Considering the heterogeneity of the concept, it must be stated
that sexuality training is an area in which there are multiple ap-
proaches and visions. Sexuality is part of an integral education,
having as a priority value and importance to society [ 10], a sit-
uation that transforms sexual education into a right and a duty
in society of the 21st century. During 2018, UNESCO updates the
concept to Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE), which de-
fines as; a curriculum-based teaching and learning process that
addresses the cognitive, psychological, physical and social aspects
of sexuality.
At present, it is the duty of the different socialization agents to
promote it, especially the school, as the main formal educational
agent; and the family, as the first and most influential agent of infor-
mal education [ 11]. Aware that sex education has several challenges
to face, it seems pertinent to us to delve into such issues as theimpact of technologies in the educational and sexual sphere, thus
bringing us closer to the characteristics and reality in which the
new generation of students develops.
2.2 Sexuality in the digital age
New technologies and their virtuality provide us with new ways
to relate in the sexual sphere. In this sense, sexuality presents an
important change, which, existing before the digital age, is being
enhanced by the strength of social networks and by the incursion
of technology into everyday life [ 12]. Thanks to technological ad-
vancement and the implementation of the Internet, it is necessary
to reflect on how sexuality is changed in people’s lives. Normalizing
sexuality, breaking myths and releasing suppressed sexual behavior
are actions that can and should be enhanced today.
In the face of this reality, another profound transformation, equal
or greater, is taking place in human relations and in the exercise of
sexuality [ 2], hence cyberspace makes possible new and diverse so-
cial and sexual practices in adolescents and young people. However,
the misuse of technologies implies new and harmful risks.
Until recently, talking about dangers from ICT was not much
questioned. Today, more and more risks and inappropriate con-
tent are being offered via the Internet in digital format [ 13]. The
speed at which technological advances occur has made the way
we manage our privacy and identity change constantly [ 14], so it
depends on the use that technologies are given the benefit or risk
that may exist. It seems essential to deepen the area and consider
the characteristics and singularities that lead us to talk about on-
line sexual victimization in cyberspaces, which is associated with
adverse emotional and psychological consequences [15].
2.3 Educational challenges in the face of
emerging sexual risks in cyberspace
Due to the impact of technologies on day-to-day activities and the
dominant culture, increased exposure to psychological and crimi-
nological risks by girls, boys and adolescents [ 16]. It is therefore
necessary to recognize that the integration of ICT into education en-
tails multiple challenges that require transformation of educational
beliefs and models [17].
We agree with the authors Montiel and Agustina [ 16], who em-
phasize the requirement to understand that the proper way to curb
these victimization phenomena requires prevention, education, and
progressive learning programs in the exercise of responsible free-
dom in the sexual and digital environment. As currently formulated,
the guidance on sex education is over-cautious, and it seems likely
to fall short of educating for autonomous choice in today’s sexual-
ized environment [ 18]. For this, new educational policies are needed
to incorporate key themes, encouraging students to be responsible
actors in their sexual process and development.
2.4 Teacher Training
Social transformations also operate on educational contexts, forcing
a constant review of many of the guidelines in both teacher training
and curriculum content. As we mentioned, one of the areas that
has not been recognized in formal education is sexuality, as well as
technological education, which are essential topics in our research.
738The role of sexuality in initial teacher training: Sex education as an educational strategy TEEM’21, October 26–29, 2021, Barcelona, Spain
While teachers in the field may recognize students’ needs and
interest in comprehensive sexuality education, too little training
is an example of insufficient structural supports for this role [ 19].
Sexuality education should include opportunities for young people
to develop effective life in all areas [ 20.], so, it is not strange to
think that the teaching role requires deep changes linked to the
demands of the new generations. In addition, the emergence of
new technologies that have forced teachers to change their role in
society is added [ 21], with the training institutions being the ones
that must ensure that they respond to this new educational reality.
In this line, the proposals for change that teacher training re-
quires must integrate the results of research and educational innova-
tions that are carried out in the educational and social contexts [ 22],
it refers to the incorporation of innovative themes that allow future
teachers to feel more prepared in exercising their role. Indeed, it is
necessary to introduce topics such as sexuality in the educational
curriculum, thus being able to respond to years of inconsistency
and irregularities in relation to the area.
3 HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES
The following research work is based on the following hypothesis:
The integration of a sexuality training program will lead to collab-
orative learning and development of skills and competencies in the
area of sexuality by future teachers.
The study aims to promote the development of competences in
the area of sexuality through a teacher training program in students
of pedagogy careers.
•Describe the competencies acquired by future teachers in
the area of sexuality.
•Describe the factors that facilitate or hinder the development
of skills in the area of sexual education in teacher training.
•Describe the advantages and disadvantages of integrating
educational activities in the area of sexual education into
teacher training.
•Diagnose the needs of future teachers to include sex educa-
tion in their educational practices.
•Identify the expectations of future teachers about their sexual
education training and its benefits in the student’s teaching-
learning process.
•To propose strategies aimed at the development of the com-
petences of sexuality in the initial training of teachers.
•Favor the scope of autonomy and the empowerment of teach-
ers toward sexuality training, offering guidelines for im-
provement in sex education.
4 RESEARCH APPROACH AND METHODS
4.1 Methodological approach to study research
and study design
The research methodology will be developed under a mixed ap-
proach, with the intention of being able to develop deeper and
more interpretative aspects [ 23], in which the possibilities of each
methodology are valued, respecting their respective contributions
[24]. This approach allows a broader and deeper perspective of the
phenomenon of study, taking real advantage of the complementary
nature of quantitative and qualitative orientations [25].Action research is used to provide information to guide decision-
making for programs, processes and structural reforms, and is part
of its aim to improve concrete practices [ 26]. According to Sandin
[27], “action research essentially aims to promote social change,
transform reality, and make people aware of their role in this process
of transformation”, line that interests to follow in this research.
A sequential exploratory design (DEXPLOS) involving an initial
phase of qualitative data collection and analysis followed by one
where quantitative data are collected and analyzed is proposed as a
study method [25] (Figure 1).
The modality will be of derivative type in which the collection
and analysis of quantitative data will be done based on qualita-
tive data. For its effect, the exploratory design will be carried out
according to the following phases:
Phase 1. Information collection. The initial theoretical review is
carried out through the collection of information and documentary
analysis, in order to carry out a systematic review of literature
justifying the state of the matter [ 28,29].To collect qualitative data
and analyze them: Considering that the objective of this study is to
contribute through the design of a training program, the qualitative
orientation will consist in the exploration and description of the
reality of sexual education in university training aimed at future
teachers, as well as in the opinion of education professionals and
experts in sex education. Information collection techniques will be;
the collection and analysis of documents (educational programs, leg-
islative frameworks), semi-structured in-depth interviews (targeted
at experts in the area) and the development of focus groups (partic-
ipation of the educational community as teachers, managers and
representatives), which allow to obtain information on a focused
topic considering the interaction with others [30].
Phase 2. Use the results to build a quantitative instrument: The
results of the first stage will be used for the development of the
quantitative phase. Based on this database, and considering quanti-
tative guidance, the technique of collecting information will be the
design and construction of a questionnaire, applied in a sample of
teachers in training. The questionnaire shall be tested for validity
(expert judgment) and its reliability (pilot application) shall be deter-
mined before final application. In addition, data triangulation will
be used, which represents the maximum degree of integration [ 31],
which consists in the verification and comparison of the informa-
tion obtained through the use of both methodological approaches,
providing us with greater security and certainty on the scientific
conclusions and guaranteeing a greater validity of the study [25].
Phase 3. Administer the instrument to the study sample: With
the final results, a proposal will be developed that integrates the
central elements that affect the process and phenomenon of sexual
education. The final result (sexuality training program) is applied
in the representative sample.
4.2 Population and simple
In terms of qualitative study, the study population will be experts
in the area of sexuality in the country (sexologists, psychologists,
social workers, midwives, etc.) and the educational community
(teachers, managers and agents). On the other hand, in the quantita-
tive study, considering the population composed of the teachers in
training, an attempt will be made to obtain a representative sample
739TEEM’21, October 26–29, 2021, Barcelona, Spain Daniela Dinamarca Figueroa et al.
Figure 1: Figure 1. Schematic of the sequential exploratory design (DEXPLOS)
in which the size of the sample will be chosen by means of the
representative and random sampling technique. The criteria for
exclusion from the sample shall be students from university centers
who are not studying pedagogy.
4.3 Instruments and variables
The research seeks to propose strategies through a training program
that takes advantage of sexuality education to be addressed in
Chilean classrooms. To this end, the instruments will be determined;
in-depth interviews and focus groups will be used for key actors and
professionals in the country’s education system. The representative
sample of the population will use the questionnaire technique,
which will be evaluated by experts in the area of knowledge. The
quality criteria for these techniques will be credibility, authenticity
and transferability.
As regards the variables, the level of knowledge reaching in
relation to the area of sexuality and the level of motivation to
the topic and their subsequent teaching by future teachers will
be considered. On the other hand, reference is made to the study
carried out by Cofré and Donoso [ 32], in which they visualize as
variables the level of knowledge on human sexuality by future
teachers, the perception of sexuality education in the university
and the opinion on sexuality education as a subject in the Chilean
educational curriculum.
4.4 Data analysis
In terms of qualitative data, the relationships between the informa-
tion received by the participants will be sought. On the techniques
used, content analysis will be used with support in the Atlas.Ti
and/or NVivo program, essential element for data processing [ 33].
For the analysis of quantitative data, the SPSS program will be used,
where descriptive techniques will be carried out, extracting the
tables of descriptive statistics of frequencies and percentages of
each question in the questionnaire. Subsequently, cross-tables or
contingency tables will be applied between the different variables
in order to be able to compare data.
To ensure ethical-legal considerations, this research will follow
the guidelines and ethical aspects of reliability, integrity and respect
for the human rights of the participants, the aforementioned studies
and their respective design, Governed by the codes of ethics of the
2018 ETHICAL Guide to BERA Educational Research [34].
5 RESULTS AND FUTURE STEPS
So far, the current progress of this investigation consists in the
development of the three-year temporary planning, the delimitation
and dimension of the study topic, the development of the theoretical
framework and revision of the methodological proposal has begun.Currently, teacher training focused on the development of sexual-
ity competencies offers a field little explored according to systematic
literature reviews, which would allow innovative resources to be
implemented in an educational context.
Consequently, this proposal seeks to contribute to the field of
educational innovation, providing valuable knowledge that will
enable future teachers to have the strategies necessary to address
the area of sexuality in classrooms. It also seeks to develop com-
petencies in teacher that allow the development of students in the
required competencies of the current society and thus be able to
foster and anticipate possible difficulties in the digital society.
