ABSTRACT
All types of multimedia data, including digital images, audio, text,
and video, are now easily accessible on the internet due to the
phenomenal growth of internet services and wireless telecommuni-
cation systems, including mobile and computer systems, in order to
achieve a specific degree of security, integrity, and secrecy as well
as to prevent malicious access to the information. In contrast, for
data storage and transmission, cryptographic procedures are neces-
sary. This study presents brand-new, very effective colour image
encryption and decryption algorithms that use diffusion and pixel
scrambling. At first Zig-Zag permutation was used to scramble the
data. Then, by concealing the statistical makeup of the pixels, the
two-dimensional Lozi map is used to distort further the connection
between neighbouring pixels in the original image. Furthermore,
the diffusion in three colour channels is accomplished using a 3D
logistic map. During the decryption process, the image pixels are
again moved back to their original positions. The chaotic mapping
technique encrypts images to reduce the correlation between en-
crypted and unencrypted versions. As described in this study, the
tested and examined encryption algorithm on certain colour photos
showed substantial security and authenticity to resist statistical
and differential cyber attacks.

The security of information during communication has become a
crucial and pressing issue as a result of the widespread distribution
of multimedia data via wireless networks and the internet, par-
ticularly for digital images, given their advantageous parameters,
such as their enormous data capacity, strong correlation, and high
levels of redundancy, among their pixels [ 2]. One of the crucial tech-
nologies for guaranteeing the confidentiality of the transmission of
image and video data is digital encryption. An image encryption
system’s primary goal is to transform the image data from readable
to obfuscated form on an open network, protecting the plain image
in the process. A wide range of applications, including the military,
archaeology, medical imaging, video surveillance, secret communi-
cation, and ordinary living, including financial data, may use digital
image encryption [ 1]. For this popular multimedia application, re-
searchers have proposed a number of digital image encryption
algorithms, all of which aim to prevent unauthorised users from ac-
cessing the image’s information. For the security of real-time image
transmission across communication networks and the internet, a
variety of strategies have been put forward recently, including key
generation-based data encryption, information processing-based
approaches, and image-chaotic-based systems [ 4]. A chaotic strat-
egy depends on diffusion, and confusion processes are one of those
that are often employed. Due to its inherent characteristics, in-
cluding pseudo-random behaviour, sensitivity to the beginning
state, a non-linear dynamic system, and unexpected manners [ 9], it
performs well in cryptographic systems.
An innovative method for quick and safe digital image cryptog-
raphy is presented in this study. The suggested system first zig-zags
the location of the image’s pixel positions. Second, Lozi mapping
is a better match for this item since it gives greater pixel shuffle
and security than the specified encrypted technique. The image is
finally encrypted using the 3D logistic map based technique [ 8].
The chaotic mapping approach is intended to blur the connection
between the plaintext and encrypted images. The main goal of the
suggested techniques is to prevent image data loss during decryp-
tion so that the plain image may be created from the cipher image
much more quickly and easily [10].
The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 dis-
plays materials and methods used in this work. Section 3 proposes
and discusses an image encryption technique based on the 2D Lozi
map and 3D logistic mapping. Section 4 discusses the experiment
findings, and the proposed method’s security is evaluated using
cryptanalysis. Section 5 dealt with the paper’s conclusion.ICIMMI 2022, December 23–24, 2022, Jaipur, India R.V. Ravi, et al.
2 ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES USED
This section deals with the proposed encryption approach and the
techniques used such as 2D Zig-Zag Transformation, 3D Logistic
mapping, 2D Lozi Map etc. with small description.
2.1 2D Zig-Zag Transformation
According to the ’Z’ form, the original matrix elements are suc-
cessively scanned, and the scanned components are consecutively
stored in a vector. The vectors are then transformed together into
a 2D matrix [ 12] [11]. Figure 1 shows the Zig-Zag transition for a
4×4matrix. Initially, the transformation begins with element 1,
which is the matrix’s top-left corner. To get a vector, each member
of the matrix is travelled through individually using the zig-zag
route shown in Figure 1. Finally, a 2D matrix is created from the
vector using the raster order.
Figure 1: Zig-Zag Permutation
2.2 3D Logistic Mapping
In order to gain more intricacy, authors in [ 3] expanded the two-
dimensional chaotic map into three dimensions. Eq.1 contains the
3D logistic chaos [8]:
 
𝑥𝑖+1=𝜆𝑥𝑖(1−𝑥𝑖)+𝛽𝑦2
𝑖𝑥𝑖+𝛼𝑧3
𝑖
𝑦𝑖+1=𝜆𝑦𝑖(1−𝑦𝑖)+𝛽𝑧2
𝑖𝑦𝑖+𝛼𝑥3
𝑖,
𝑧𝑖+1=𝜆𝑧𝑖(1−𝑧𝑖)+𝛽𝑥2
𝑖𝑧𝑖+𝛼𝑦2
𝑖(1)
The 3D map makes things even less predictable because it adds
another dimension to the system, making things even more chaotic.
To get this randomness, the beginning conditions for 𝑧,𝑥, and𝑦,
should be between 0and1. Parameter values should be between
3.53<𝜆<3.81,0<𝛽<0.022and0<𝛼<0.015.
2.3 2D Lozi Map
The Lozi map (shown in Eq 2), initially shown in Lozi (1978), is
comparable to the Henon map and is a continually more straight-
forward than the Henon map [ 7]. This is a dynamic system with
discrete time.𝑥𝑛+1=1−𝑎|𝑥𝑛|+𝑏𝑦𝑛
𝑦𝑛+1=𝑏𝑥𝑛(2)
where the system’s parameters are 𝑎=1.7and𝑏=0.5. The funda-
mental difference between it and the Henon map is the discontinuity
in its derivative.3 PROPOSED ALGORITHM
In the proposed algorithm, initially, the plaintext image undergoes
the separation of R, G and B colour channels for parallel processing.
Further, each pixel in these three colour channels will be shuffled
using the Zig-Zag algorithm. Further, these shuffled pixels will
undergo an additional shuffling process according to the 2D chaotic
sequences from the 2D Lozi map. As the shuffling is not enough
to achieve perfect encryption, the values of pixels in each colour
plane will be XORed with the 3D sequences generated using the 3D
logistic map. Finally, the colour planes will be integrated to form
the 3 channel ciphertext image. The block diagram of the proposed
encryption algorithm is shown in Figure 2.

4.1 Histogram Analysis
An essential statistical tool for determining the effectiveness of
an image cryptosystem is histogram evaluation. Figure 4 displays
the histograms for the three channels of the original Splash im-
age as well as the correspondingly created cipher image [ 5]. The
majority of the digital image was accomplished smoothly, while
the original image’s histogram is non-uniform with a distinct peak.
The cipher image, on the other hand, is noise-like and seems to
be not associated with the first plain image, whereas the retrieved
image is an exact reconstruction of the original image. The image
that was recovered is an exact image of the original. The fact that
the histogram in the encrypted image is looking very smooth and
consistent shows that no statistical information from the initial
plain image was added. As a result, the suggested approach can
defend against cipher image and statistical assaults.
4.2 Correlation Factor Analysis
An important measure for estimating two neighbouring pixels in
the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal orientations is the correlation
factor (CF). N number of neighbouring pixel pairs are chosen, and
𝑥and𝑦are two of those pairings [ 6]. The formula for calculating
the correlation factor is in Eq 3
𝐶𝐹=Í𝑁
𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖−¯𝑥)(𝑦𝑖−¯𝑦)
√︃Í𝑁
𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖−¯𝑥)2√︃Í𝑁
𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖−¯𝑦)2(3)
Let𝑁now equal 2000 . The findings of the computations used to
correlate the original and encrypted images are shown in Table 1.
The fact that the correlation factor between adjacent pixels in the
three directions is low suggests that the pixels are not associated.The original image has a strong correlation factor that is very near 1.
In comparison, the cipher image’s correlation factor is low, almost
zero. Thus, these findings attest to the robustness of the suggested
cryptosystem. Table 1 shows the values of correlation coefficient.

4.3 Differential Attacks
An attacker may get significant information by modifying certain
pixels of the plaintext image. The UACI and the NPCR [ 5] are often
used to assess how well the ciphertext image resists differential
attacks.
With the use of a single secret key, we used the described encryp-
tion method to encrypt 𝑃1and𝑃2in order to acquire their respective
encrypted images, denoted by the letters 𝐶1and𝐶2, where𝑃2is
the result of changing one pixel from the original plain image 𝑃1
[5]. The NPCR and UACI might thereafter be calculated by Eq 4.

4.4 Information Entropy
The matrix 𝐸(𝑚)of the m-dimensional image data matrix repre-
sented the entropy, which is a measure of how unsafe the image
data is. Eq 5 shows the calculation of entropy.ICIMMI 2022, December 23–24, 2022, Jaipur, India R.V. Ravi, et al.
𝐸(𝑚)=−255∑︁
𝑖=0𝑃𝑏(𝑚𝑖)log2(𝑃𝑏(𝑚𝑖)) (5)
An exact random image would provide 256-pixel values with an
equal probability, where 𝑃𝑏(𝑚𝑖)stands for the probability of 𝑚𝑖.
Consequently, the information entropy value is closer to 8in theory
[5]. The entropy estimates of the Lena and Baboon cipher images
are shown in Table 3 to be rather close to the measured values. The
results therefore demonstrate that the suggested cryptosystem may
effectively defend against an information entropy attack.

5 CONCLUSION
The zig-zag transformation, 2D Lozi map-based permutation, and
3D logistic map-based diffusion are the foundations for the innova-
tive colour image encryption technique proposed in this research.
The proposed zig-zag transformation has the potential to greatly re-
duce the correlation between the pixels in the R, G, and B elements
during the permutation step. Additionally, to add to the intricacy,
we again disorganised the placement of pixels using permutation
and a 2D Lozi map. Additionally, for diffusion, we used sequences
from a 3D logistic map, changing the pixel values as a result. Ex-
perimental findings and comparisons with other algorithms of a
similar kind show that our approach performs superbly and has
high security. The suggested approach may thus be used in reality
for safely an securely transferring the colour images. The suggested
algorithm is focused on colour images at the moment.
