ABSTRACT
Feature selection is a prevalent data preprocessing paradigm for
various learning tasks. Due to the expensive cost of acquiring su-
pervision information, unsupervised feature selection sparks great
interests recently. However, existing unsupervised feature selection
algorithms do not have fairness considerations and suffer from a
high risk of amplifying discrimination by selecting features that
are over associated with protected attributes such as gender, race,
and ethnicity. In this paper, we make an initial investigation of
the fairness-aware unsupervised feature selection problem and de-
velop a principled framework, which leverages kernel alignment
to find a subset of high-quality features that can best preserve the
information in the original feature space while being minimally
correlated with protected attributes. Specifically, different from
the mainstream in-processing debiasing methods, our proposed
framework can be regarded as a model-agnostic debiasing strategy
that eliminates biases and discrimination before downstream learn-
ing algorithms are involved. Experimental results on real-world
datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves a good trade-off
between feature utility and promoting feature fairness.

readability and interpretability by maintaining the physical mean-
ings of original features, it is often preferred in high-stake applica-
tions [ 12,20,25]. Traditional feature selection algorithms can be
mainly categorized as supervised and unsupervised methods [ 15].
As supervision information is often costly to amass, unsupervised
methods have attracted increasing attention. However, most of the
existing algorithms do not have fairness considerations and may
exhibit discriminatory actions toward specific groups by over asso-
ciating protected attributes (e.g., gender, race) [ 5,8,22]. Though it is
intuitive to manually remove the protected attributes to avoid direct
discrimination, some non-protected attributes that are highly cor-
related with the protected attributes may still cause unintentional
discrimination problems (e.g., residential zip code may indicate the
race information because of the residential areas) [13, 29].
In this paper, we make an initial investigation of the fairness
issues of unsupervised feature selection and develop a general
model-agnostic debiasing solution. Our efforts have the potential to
alleviate unwanted biases before applying downstream learning al-
gorithms and are complementary to the mainstream in-processing
algorithmic fairness research [ 22]. However, the problem is non-
trivial with the following challenges. (1) Feature selection should
achieve a good trade-off between fairness and feature utility. How-
ever, without label information, we are in short of effective evalua-
tion criteria to quantify these two targets simultaneously. (2) Due
to the trade-off between utility and fairness, it is difficult to achieve
the maximums of both. It is necessary to explicitly exclude the
features which have strong correlations with protected attributes.
To tackle the challenges above, we propose a novel Fairness-
aware Unsupervised Feature Selection (FUFS) framework (as shown
in Fig. 1). To ensure that the selected features do not cause much
utility loss, we select features that can maximally preserve the orig-
inal information. Additionally, we impose fairness constraints to
enforce the protected attributes being minimally correlated with
the selected features while over associating with a small number
of unselected features. All the considerations are modeled in a
joint optimization framework. The major contributions of our work

3548are as follows: (1) We address a crucial and newly emerging prob-
lem, fairness-aware unsupervised feature selection. (2) We propose
a novel FUFS framework, which selects high-quality features by
preserving original information and obeying the fairness consid-
erations. (3) We formulate two desiderata of fairness-aware unsu-
pervised feature selection (i.e., utility maximization and fairness
promotion) as an optimization problem with a principled solution.
(4) We validate the selected features by utility and fairness measure-
ments and corroborate the superiority of our proposed framework.
2 THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK - FUFS
In this work, we assume there are 𝑛data instances, the matrix
P∈R𝑝×𝑛denotes the set of 𝑝protected attributes for instances
(e.g., age, gender, and race), and the matrix X∈R𝑑×𝑛denotes the
set of𝑑non-protected attributes (often we have 𝑝≪𝑑).
Problem Definition (Fairness-Aware Unsupervised Feature Selec-
tion). Given the input data X∈R𝑑×𝑛andP∈R𝑝×𝑛with𝑑non-
protected attributes and 𝑝protected attributes, the problem aims to
select a subset of 𝑘features among 𝑑non-protected attributes ( 𝑘≪𝑑)
which can maximally preserve the information in the original feature
space while being minimally correlated with the protected attributes.
2.1 Maximizing Feature Utility
In an unsupervised scenario, we need to seek alternative evaluation
criteria to assess the importance of features. To ensure that the
selected features can well capture the information embedded in the
original feature space, we would like to maximize the correlation
between the selected features and the original ones. However, since
the original features could be high-dimensional, complex nonlinear
correlations could exist between these two feature spaces. Hence,
we measure their nonlinear correlation with kernel alignment [7].
Suppose the vector m∈{0,1}𝑑is the feature selection indicator
vector such that 1⊤m=𝑘, where𝑚𝑖=1if the𝑖-th feature is
selected, otherwise 𝑚𝑖=0. The data matrix on the selected features
can be obtained as M=diag(m)X. Then we define a kernel 𝜅which
implicitly computes the similarity between instances in a high-
dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) [ 1], such
thatK𝑖𝑗=𝜅(X∗𝑖,X∗𝑗)andKM
𝑖𝑗=𝜅(M∗𝑖,M∗𝑗). In practice, we can
choose polynomial kernel or RBF kernel. Denoting the centering
matrix as H=I−1
𝑛11⊤, these two kernel matrices after centering
can be denoted as K𝑐=HKH andKM𝑐=HKMH, respectively. Then
we can characterize the inherent nonlinear correlation between
these two feature spaces with the centered kernel alignment:
𝜌
K,KM
=Tr(K𝑐KM
𝑐)=Tr(HKHHKMH). (1)
With the observation that HH=HandTr(AB)=Tr(BA) (where
A,B∈R𝑛×𝑛), we can further simplify 𝜌
K,KM
asTr(HKHKM).
Our goal expects that the selected features in mcan maximally
preserve the information embedded in the original feature space.
2.2 Promoting Feature Fairness
Maximizing Eq. (1) alone does not address the fairness considera-
tions as the selected features may be associated with the protected
attributes in P. Thus, we further impose fairness constraints to
make the selected features in Mnot well aligned with the protected
attributes P. To achieve this goal, suppose KP∈R𝑛×𝑛is the kernelmatrix of P, we can also leverage centered kernel alignment to min-
imize the nonlinear correlation between MandPin kernel space:
𝜌
KM,KP
=Tr(HKMHKP). (2)
To further enforce that the sensitive information is eliminated in
the selected features, a small number of unselected features should
exhibit high correlation with the protected attributes. Hence, we
further define a decomposition indicator g∈{0,1}𝑑to indicate the
index of non-protected attributes that are highly correlated with
P, where 1⊤g=𝑙, and𝑙denotes the number of sensitive features.
Ideally, the nonzero indices of gshould not overlap with those of
m. Hence, the data matrix Gcorresponding to gcan be obtained
asG=diag(g)(I−diag(m))X. Assume the corresponding kernel
matrix is KG∈R𝑛×𝑛, then the centered kernel alignment can also
be utilized to maximize the nonlinear correlation between GandP:
𝜌
KG,KP
=Tr(HKGHKP). (3)
2.3 Objective Function of FUFS
Combining the two desiderata of fairness-aware unsupervised fea-
ture selection, we obtain a joint constrained optimization problem:
minm,g−Tr
HKHKM
+𝛼Tr
HKMHKP
−𝛼Tr
HKGHKP
(4)
s.t.m,g∈{0,1}𝑑,1⊤m=𝑘,1⊤g=𝑙,
where𝛼is a hyperparameter that can control how strong we
would like to enforce the fairness of unsupervised feature selection.
The optimization problem in Eq. (5) is not joint convex w.r.t. m
andgsimultaneously. Although we can employ alternating opti-
mization scheme for a local optimum, the whole optimization still
remains difficult since mandgare discrete. To address this issue,
we relax the discrete constraints to a real-valued vector in the range
of[0,1]. We rewrite the optimization problem as follows:
minm,gL=−Tr
HKHKM
+𝛼Tr
HKMHKP
−𝛼Tr
HKGHKP
+𝛽(∥m∥1+∥g∥1)s.t.m,g∈[0,1]𝑑, (5)
where theℓ1-norm is introduced for the sparsity of model pa-
rameters mandg. The hyperparameter 𝛽is used to control the
number of selected features that are relevant and do not correlate
with protected attributes and the number of unselected features
that are highly correlated with protected attributes, respectively.
Updating mand g.We update two model parameters mandg
alternatively until the objective function converges to a local opti-
mum. The update rules are as follows:
𝑚𝑖←𝑃[𝑚𝑖−𝜂𝜕L/𝜕𝑚𝑖], 𝑔𝑖←𝑃[𝑔𝑖−𝜂𝜕L/𝜕𝑔𝑖], (6)
where𝑃[𝑥]is a box projection operator which projects 𝑥into a
bounded range. Specifically, since we relax the constraints of 𝑚𝑖
and𝑔𝑖in the range of[0,1], we have𝑃[𝑥]=0if𝑥<0,𝑃[𝑥]=1if
𝑥>1, and otherwise 𝑃[𝑥]=𝑥.𝜂is the learning rate.
3 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS
3.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets . We perform experiments on four public available datasets.
(1)Crime1combines census data, law enforcement data, and crime
data of US communities. We define the percentage of population for

3549African American as a protected attribute. We define two clusters
by the number of crimes and the cutoff threshold is 0.15 crimes
per 100K population. We have 2,215 communities described by 147
different attributes. (2) Adolescent2comes from a longitudinal
study of adolescents. The attributes are personal information of
the interviewees and their answers to a questionnaire. Bio-sex is
regarded as the protected attribute and we define two clusters by
whether their Picture Vocabulary test score is more than 65. In total,
it contains 6,504 instances and 2,793 attributes. (3) Google+3comes
from Google+, which contains user features and social relations
within multiple social circles. Each instance refers to a user and
attributes are obtained from personal information of users. Gender
is regarded as the protected attribute. We have two clusters defined
by the social circles that the users belong to without overlapping.
The dataset consists of 2,437 users and 1,695 features. (4) Toxicity4
is obtained from a Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, where
each comment is considered as an instance. We apply a tokenizer to
transform text data to numerical values. The identity label ‘female’
is regarded as the protected attribute. The features are from iden-
tity labels and comment texts. There are two clusters defined by
whether the comment is regarded toxic or not. We collect a subset
of 200 instances with 4,253 features.
Evaluation Criteria . For unsupervised feature selection, cluster-
ing performance is often used as an evaluation metric [ 15]. Specif-
ically, we use Clustering Accuracy (ACC) andNormalized Mutual
Information (NMI), and higher values often imply better feature util-
ity. Meanwhile, we use the widely adopted metrics Balance [18] and
define a new fairness metric Proportion to quantify fairness—the
selected features are considered fairer with higher value of Balance
and lower value of Proportion. They are defined as follows:
𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 =min
𝑖min𝑔|𝐶𝑖∩𝑋𝑔|
|𝐶𝑖|, 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =Õ
𝑖max 𝑔|𝐶𝑖∩𝑋𝑔|
|𝐶𝑖|,(7)
where𝐶𝑖and𝑋𝑔denote the 𝑖-th cluster and the 𝑔-th protected
subgroup regarding the sensitive attribute.
Competitive Methods and Implementation . We compare our
proposed framework FUFS with the following unsupervised fea-
ture selection methods that are widely used: (1) LapScore [11]; (2)
MCFS [3]; (3) UDFS [28]; (4) NDFS [19]; (5) REFS [16].
We follow the original papers to specify the hyperparameters
for the baselines. For FUFS, we set 𝛼=1,𝛽=0.1onCrime and
Google+ while𝛼=0.01,𝛽=10onAdolescent andToxicity. The
original distribution of the protected groups in Crime andGoogle+
is more unbalanced so a larger value of 𝛼is necessary to eliminate
discrimination. Whereas Adolescent andToxicity have more
features and a larger value of 𝛽is necessary for sparsity. Besides,
we specify the kernel function as the RBF kernel. We first apply each
method to select the top- 𝑘ranked features and employ K-means
clustering on the selected features. Since the results of K-means
depend on initialization, we repeat K-means 50 times and report the
average results. Choosing the optimal number of selected features
is still an open problem, thus we follow conventional settings [ 15]
to vary the number of selected features as {10%,15%,...,40%}of the
original features and report the best results.

3.2 Performance Evaluation
The experimental results are shown in Tables 1-4. The number
in parentheses denotes the percentage of features when the best
performance is achieved. Values in red cell indicates the best result,
and blue cell indicates the second best one. We make the following
observations: (1) FUFS significantly outperforms the baseline meth-
ods in terms of Balance andProportion with the best performance
in almost all cases and the second best performance in terms of
Balance onCrime. Existing unsupervised feature selection methods
often do not have the fairness considerations and deliver the unfair
results, while our proposed FUFS framework can obtain the most
balanced clustering results across different protected subgroups. (2)
FUFS achieves a good balance between feature utility and feature
fairness. While achieving a good performance w.r.t. different fair-
ness metrics, the clustering performance on the selected features
is not jeopardized. For example, on Crime andToxicity, FUFS
achieves the second best performance in terms of ACC andNMI
while on Adolescent andGoogle+, FUFS achieves the best NMI
values and does not have obvious difference w.r.t. ACC compared
with the best baseline method. (3) The proposed FUFS framework
can achieve great performance in terms of fairness with a small
number of features. Specifically, on Adolescent andGoogle+,
FUFS achieves the best results in terms of Balance andProportion
compared with the baseline methods with merely 10%of the total
number of features. On Toxicity, FUFS achieves the best results of
fairness with 15%of the total number of features.

3.3 In-Depth Exploration of FUFS
Effects of the Number of Selected Features. Choosing an opti-
mal number of features is still an open problem, thus we vary the
number of selected features as {10%,15%,20%,25%,30%,35%,40%}
of the total feature number and investigate how the feature utility
and fairness performance change. We only show the results on
Toxicity (Fig. 2) as we have similar observations on other datasets.
As we can see, ACC andNMI first increase and then keep stable
when the number of selected features increases. Meanwhile, the
fairness performance is the best when only 10% of features are
selected (lower values of Proportion denotes fairer results). The fair-
ness performance gradually decreases when the number of selected
features increases, since more features correlated with sensitive
features could be included in the selected feature subset.
Effects of the Decomposition Indicator Vector g. In order to
investigate the effect of the vector g, we remove it from our frame-
work and compare its performance with the original FUFS. The
results on Crime andGoogle+ shown in Fig. 3 imply that the in-
troduction of gimproves both the utility and fairness performance.
We also compare the fairness performance based on the top-ranked
features in mandgas shown in Table 5. The number in parentheses
denotes the percentage of features when the best performance is
achieved. Obviously the clustering results based on the top-ranked
features in the vector mare fairer than those in g. It shows the
effectiveness of introducing the decomposition indicator vector g.
Parameter Study . The framework has two important hyperparam-
eters𝛼and𝛽. We first fix 𝛽=0.1and vary𝛼among{0.001,0.01,0.1,
1,10,100,1000}. Next, We fix 𝛼=1and vary𝛽among{0.001,0.01,
0.1,1,10,100,1000}. Due to space limit, we only show the results

onGoogle+ in terms of ACC andBalance, as shown in Fig. 4. It
should be noted that the X-axis is plotted in a log scale, we do not
expect to see a smooth curve. The results imply that the cluster-
ing performance is relatively stable when 𝛼=1,𝛽∈[0.001,0.1]
or𝛼∈[0.001,0.1],𝛽=0.1. When the parameter 𝛼increases, the
algorithm becomes more partial to the fairness consideration with
decreasing ACC and increasing Balance. Besides, the fairness per-
formance decreases a lot if 𝛽is specified as a very large value.
4 RELATED WORK
Unsupervised Feature Selection. Unsupervised methods often
rely on alternative evaluation criteria based on characteristics of
data. Specifically, similarity based methods [ 11,31] select features
that can best preserve the local manifold structure of data. Some
methods aim to select features that can best reconstruct [ 16,30]
or maximally preserve the original information [ 27]. Many studies
learn the pseudo label from data by exploiting local/global dis-
criminative information and select features to predict these pseudo
labels with ℓ2,1-norm based regression [ 17,19]. Recently, data re-
construction [ 9,16,30] emerged as a new criterion to evaluate
feature relevance, which evaluates the capability of features in
approximating the original data through data reconstruction.
Fairness of Unsupervised Learning Methods. Here we review
some related fairness topics in terms of clustering and representa-
tion learning. The initial work [4] defines fair variants of classical
clustering problems such as 𝑘-center and 𝑘-median and proposes
the concepts of fairlets and fairlet decomposition, which is further
extended to 𝑘-means++ algorithm by [ 24]. Other related works
focus on scalable fair clustering [ 2], fair spectral clustering [ 14],
and deep fair clustering [ 18,26]. Another family of work aims to
learn fair representations. Fair PCA [ 6] is a two-step algorithm
for dimension reduction. Fair Autoencoders [ 21,23] encourage in-
dependence between sensitive and latent factors of variation for
representation learning. Extended work [ 6] learns general-purpose
flexible fair representations regarding multiple sensitive attributes.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we addressed a novel problem of fairness-aware un-
supervised feature selection and developed a principled framework
FUFS. FUFS leverages the technique of kernel alignment to se-
lect high-quality features that achieve a good balance between
improving downstream learning tasks and eliminating sensitive
information that is highly correlated with protected attributes.
These two desiderata were modeled together in a joint optimiza-
tion framework. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrated the superiority of the proposed FUFS framework in
terms of feature utility and feature fairness.
