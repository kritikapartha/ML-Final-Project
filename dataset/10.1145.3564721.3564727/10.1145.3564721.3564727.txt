ABSTRACT
Hackathon-style coding events are a popular and promising ap-
proach to broadening participation in computer science and engi-
neering. We present a quantitative analysis of self-reported perse-
verance in coding after hackathon-style events for 4,703 hackathon
participants run by the nonprofit organization CodeDay. Drawing
from previous work on broadening participation in computing, we
test hypotheses that seek to answer three questions about whether
and how hackathon-style coding events support continued engage-
ment in computing among young people: (1) Are participants from
underrepresented groups as likely to continue to engage in coding
after attending a hackathon-style event? (2) Are participants more
likely to continue to code after hackathon-style events if they attend
events with demographically similar peers? (3) Are participants
more likely to continue to code after a hackathon-style event if
they present their work? In line with many studies of broadening
participation, we find that members of underrepresented groups
are less likely to report continuing to engage in programming 10
weeks after hackathon-style events. However, we find that these
participants are more likely to report continuing to code when a
larger proportion of attendees at their event share their gender
or ethnicity. We also find that membership in underrepresented
groups is associated with a greater likelihood of continued engage-
ment when participants present their work to others at the end of
events. Our work contributes to the literature on both education
and broadening participation in computing by outlining several
conditions under which hackathon-style events may be effective in
promoting continued engagement among underrepresented young
people.

1 INTRODUCTION
Computing technology underpins today’s society and it would be
difficult to identify a single domain that has not been affected by
computers. It is critical, therefore, that young people have experi-
ences with computing that go beyond simply being users of infor-
mation technology. Unfortunately, there is persistent demographic
inequality at all levels of computing, both in industry and academia,
with both women and people of color vastly underrepresented.
While the root causes of this underrepresentation are varied and
complex, there is widespread recognition that broadening participa-
tion in computing must involve building interest in programming
among young people who are currently underrepresented.
An increasingly popular approach to building interest and con-
fidence in computing is hackathon-style events that seek to give
participants hands-on experience with coding in a social environ-
ment. Hackathons are still a relatively recent phenomenon. The
first hackathon was held by OpenBSD in 1999 for professional devel-
opers [ 23], and the first college hackathon occurred 10 years later
[25]. Hackathons are now commonly used as educational events,
with more than 200 events sponsored annually by Major League
Hacking, an organization formed to support student hackathons
[21]. Increasingly, these events are open to pre-college students.
Hack Club, an organization that curates a list of hackathons for
high school students, reports 57 events planned for 2022 before the
end of July and over 100 events each year for the previous 4 years
[11].
Although the popularity of hackathons has exploded, it is not
clear that they have been effective in promoting increased diversity
in computing. In 2019, Major League Hacking published data on
the 215 events they had supported over the previous year, reporting
that 73% of the attendees identified as male, 24% as female, and 3%
as other [ 31]. Ethnic diversity was similarly lacking—84% of the
attendees identified themselves as white/Caucasian or Asian/Pacific
Islander [31].
CodeDay is a non-profit organization with a mission to make
computing more accessible to underserved communities by organiz-
ing hackathon-like events for high school students and organizing
mentored internships for high school and college students [ 6]. Code-
Day events typically occur in multiple cities over the same weekend.
Although CodeDay locations are still predominantly within the
United States, there are some international events. This study usesKoli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland Emilia Gan, Tyler Menezes, and Benjamin Mako Hill
data collected by CodeDay from people attending more than 100
events to test hypotheses about the relationship between member-
ship in unrepresented groups, demographics of other learners at
events (which may or may not convey a sense of belonging for
certain participants), public presentation of completed work, and
continued participation in programming.
Our study uses data from 7,207 attendees of CodeDay events. Be-
cause our sample includes 2,074 individuals who identify as Black,
Latinx, Native American, or other, we are able to gain valuable
insights about the interactions between gender and ethnicity which
are often difficult to measure due to the low number of underrep-
resented participants at individual events. This work contributes
to research on informal learning and broadening participation in
computing by using unique survey data to evaluate hackathon-style
events in terms of their ability to encourage longer-term engage-
ment among those with little or no interest in computing. Moreover,
our work shows how event-level characteristics like overall demo-
graphics and the incorporation of public presentation are related
to longer-term participation in computing—especially by attendees
from underrepresented groups.
2 BACKGROUND
While many programs have been implemented to address inequali-
ties in computing, gaps in access, participation, and opportunities
persist. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s
report on “Diversity in High Tech” reveals that computing remains
a primarily White and male domain, especially in the highest paid
executive-level positions, and that women, Hispanics, and African
Americans are underrepresented at all levels of the computing in-
dustry [ 7]. The lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the computing
workforce is reflective of a long sequence of inequities and imbal-
ances, beginning from early childhood experiences and continuing
throughout adulthood [19, 35].
2.1 Hackathons
A portmanteau of the terms “hacking” and “marathon, ” “hackathons”
are time-bounded events where participants collaborate intensively
on programming tasks in a social, usually co-located, environment,
[2]. Hackathons often culminate in a public presentation of projects,
often accompanied by the awarding of prizes. The value of these
prizes can be considerable, ranging from cash, to computer hard-
ware, to job interviews, and to internship offers [ 29]. Inequality in
participation at early career stages can have far-reaching career
implications on the demographics of computing [ 27,29]. In recent
years, hackathons have become an important platform for gain-
ing skills and recognition in the computer industry, especially in
individuals’ early career stages [ 9,22,38]. Hackathons have also
left an indelible mark on the culture of work in computing and
on workplace norms [ 38]. Not surprisingly, most hackathons are
attended predominantly by white and Asian men [31].
The male-dominated and, at times, “macho” culture of hackathons
can be off-putting to women. For example, in a study by Warner
and Guo, 16% of the hackathon attendees identifying as women
surveyed cited “hacker culture” as a negative aspect of the event,
compared to only 2% of the attendees surveyed who identified as
men [ 36]. In their work on hackathon culture, Decker et al. pointout that efforts to increase participation by women, such as special
preregistration periods or “women only” events, can emphasize
and increase the sense of separation and nonbelonging that they
are trying to counteract [ 8]. They go on to suggest that consciously
designing events to be more collaborative and less focused on com-
petition can result in more welcoming events for all participants
[8]. Although persistence in coding during and after hackathons
has not been extensively studied, some researchers have reported
significant dropout rates, with up to 30% to 50% of participants
not participating in the presentation stage of events [ 12,38]. The
benefits of organizing events with various options to participate,
collaborate, and define goals have been reinforced by Kos’ work
with female-focused hackathon participants, showing that women
often attend with the goal of exploring new topics and learning new
skills and find that the competitive nature of these events works
against these goals [15].
Several hackathons have been specifically designed to broaden
participation. For example, some hackathons, such as Womxn/Hacks,
are dedicated to improving equity in computing for female-identifying
and non-gender-conforming people [ 37], while others, such as Hack
the Gap, organize hackathons and other programs to promote in-
clusivity more broadly [ 3]. As in other hackathons, participants
in these events work on projects of their own choosing and may
present their work to others at the end of the event. CodeDay events
are organized to increase interest in computing among high school
students who might not be exposed to computing and make an
effort to recruit computing novices [20].
2.2 Underrepresentation and Coding
Persistence
Research has provided insight into some of the factors that con-
tribute to the lack of diversity in computing. For example, when
forming opinions on career options, it is important for young people
to be able to see themselves fitting in [ 33]. Newcomers to coding
must overcome a variety of obstacles before reaching the point
where they see themselves as programmers. Computing careers are
still viewed, perhaps for good reasons, as unwelcoming domains
for those who do not fit the stereotypical image of a programmer.
Thus, as children, girls and members of underrepresented minority
groups may not know of anyone working in computing that they
can identify with, making it harder for them to see themselves in
computing careers.
Previous research by Margolis et al. [18], Jepson and Perl [ 14],
and Resnick and Rusk [ 28], among many others, has shown that
early exposure to computing can help counteract the negative ef-
fects of the stereotypes commonly associated with computing and
the lack of representation in the computing workforce. Popular ini-
tiatives, such as Scratch and Code.org, have shown that computing
can have wide-reaching appeal, as long as participants are given the
opportunity to feel valued and empowered. Despite the popularity
of such programs, many young people enter college without having
had such positive experiences.
Our first hypothesis aims to provide insight into this issue. The
participants in this study are primarily high school students. Many
of these students are likely in the process of figuring out what they
might want to do after they finish school. Given historical trends,Hacking with Peers Koli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland
we expect that a significant proportion of these students already
believe that a career in computing is not for them. Consequently,
we hypothesize that (H1) participants from groups who are un-
derrepresented in computing are less likely to continue coding
than participants in well represented groups . Clearly, there are
multiple demographic dimensions along which an individual might
be underrepresented. Although gender inequality in computing
is widely studied [ 18], there is also a lack of ethnic diversity [ 1].
As a result, we split our first hypothesis into two subparts. We
hypothesize both that (a) participants who do not identify as
male will be less likely to continue coding and(b) participants
who do not identify as White will be less likely to continue
coding .
2.3 Demographic Peers and Coding Persistence
Students who come from groups underrepresented in computing
often face significant barriers to participation. These include a lack
of access to technology and a lack of role models and mentors
[16,35]. As a result, these students are less likely to self-identify
as “coders” or see computing as a field open to them. Research
by Cheryan and Plaut [ 4] and Tellhed et al. [30] has shown that
the ability to identify with others in a group learning to code is
key to developing interest in belonging to that group. Our sense
is that the demographics of typical hackathons could discourage
participants from underrepresented groups by suggesting, perhaps
implicitly, that they might not belong. Walton and Cohen have
shown that for college students, if individuals feel that they have
few friends in a given domain, their sense of belonging and the
ability to perform to their full potential are negatively affected [ 34].
Given that social connection is a basic human need, hackathons that
promote a feeling of belonging may be especially effective in helping
beginners overcome initial challenges to continue participating in
programming activities. For students from demographic groups that
have not typically been well represented in computing, attending
diverse events may be an important first step in creating more
of a sense of connection. For our second hypothesis, we look at
how individual participants are affected by attending an event
with others of their same gender or ethnicity. We hypothesize
that(H2) participants who are more demographically similar
to others at their event are more likely to continue coding .
Once again, we break this down into two subhypotheses based on
gender and ethnicity: (a) participants who attend with others
of their gender will be more likely to continue coding and(b)
participants who attend with others of their ethnicity will be
more likely to continue coding .
2.4 Presenting One’s Work and Coding
Persistence
There is reason to believe that the presentation of work by partici-
pants at the end of hackathon-style events can be beneficial. Kos
includes both encouraging participants to present and providing op-
portunities to demo projects in noncompetitive settings in a list of
design recommendations for creating inclusive hackathons [ 15]. A
study of participants in the Scratch online community showed that
public sharing of user-created artifacts is associated with higher
levels of subsequent participation, but also revealed that groupsless likely to participate are also less likely to share at the earli-
est stages of their participation [ 10]. A proposed explanation is
that sharing work can initiate a virtuous cycle in which a sense of
belonging leads to increased sharing, which, in turn, contributes
to an increased sense of belonging [ 10]. Furthermore, connecting
with peers and feeling accepted by them is important for the devel-
opment of one’s social identity and sense of belonging [ 32]. This
dynamic can be elusive for members of underrepresented groups.
Often, hackathons are set up such that end-of-event presenta-
tions are a celebration of participants’ accomplishments. We suspect
that among students who do not already feel connected to coding,
presenting their work is more likely to be viewed as a risk with
the potential to expose their lack of expertise and label them as
outsiders. Successful presentation of work to a supportive audience
of peers can therefore be especially significant to these participants
as it validates that this work is something they can do successfully
and be recognized for. Consequently, we hypothesize that (H3) par-
ticipants who present their work are more likely to continue
coding . For the third time, we split this into two subhypotheses
based on gender and ethnicity: (a) participants who do not iden-
tify as male and who present their work will be more likely
to continue coding , and (b) participants who do not identify
as White and who present their work will be more likely to
continue coding .
3 EMPIRICAL SETTING
We test our hypotheses using a unique dataset from the nonprofit
organization CodeDay. Since its founding in 2009, more than 58,000
people have attended CodeDay events, and more than 70% of Code-
Day attendees are from groups recognized as underrepresented in
computer science [ 6]. Although events were held virtually during
the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in March 2020, events described
in this dataset were all held in-person at various locations in the
United States over a weekend (including overnight on Saturday)
before COVID. Since November 2021, the organization has returned
to running in-person events. Events are organized to promote at-
tendance by young people local to the areas where the events are
held.
Each CodeDay event follows a similar format. Participants first
spend an hour presenting ideas for self-directed projects and self-
select into teams of 1-6. At this time, an optional 1-hour beginner
coding workshop is offered. For the next 19-20 hours, teams work
to create projects using their chosen technology. Industry mentors
and more experienced students provide guidance as needed.
CodeDay structures the final two hours of each session using
one of four methods: (1) participants are asked to present to their
peers and a panel of judges; (2) participants are asked to meet with
judges in a science fair-style exhibition format and a subset are
randomly selected to present to their peers; (3) participants are
asked to meet with judges in a science fair-style exhibition and
winners are asked to present to their peers; (4) participants are
asked to meet with judges in a science fair-style exhibition format
with no presentations to peers.
When included, presentations are comprised of a 2-minute group
demonstration of the finished project with narration, with no au-
dience questions or feedback. The focus of these presentations isKoli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland Emilia Gan, Tyler Menezes, and Benjamin Mako Hill

on the finished work and participants are asked not to create slides
or a script. Although participants can technically opt out of pre-
sentations, CodeDay staff make an effort to encourage all students
to present [ 20] and 12,729 of the 14,057 student in our full dataset
(more than 90%) are listed as having presented.
Similarly, meetings with judges focus on demonstrations of the
work without slides or a script. Judges are encouraged to ask ques-
tions as needed to determine scores in the field of effort, creativity,
and polish. The average duration of a meeting with judges is three
minutes, and the average number of judges present is three [20].
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Data
This study uses fully anonymized data from 141 unique CodeDay
sessions on 7 CodeDay weekends and 28 different locations held
between November 8, 2014 and November 12, 2016. Table 1 provides
some numerical overviews of the dataset used in this project. We
see that the events ranged in size from 13 to 351 attendees. Most
events had fewer than 150 attendees. Survey data were collected
from 14,057 hackathon attendees by CodeDay. Of these individuals,
7,207 provided demographic data. All participants who indicated
that they had “low” or “no” interest in coding prior to attending an
event were sent a 10-week postevent follow-up survey via email.
In Figure 1, we present a breakdown of attendees grouped by
gender and ethnicity for all participants for whom we had such
data (we describe how we operationalize each in the following
subsection). A demographic breakdown by interest (i.e., attendees
expressing little prior interest in coding, attendees expressing no
prior interest in coding, and attendees who received, but did not
respond to, the follow-up survey) did not differ greatly from the
heatmap shown. Additional cross tabulations are provided in the
online resources accompanying this paper (see Appendix A).
Of a total of 3,451 postevent surveys sent out to students report-
ing “low” interest, 2,411 responses were received (a 70% response
rate). Of the 1,252 individuals who reported “no” interest in coding
pre-event, 779 responded (a 62% response rate). These response
rates are quite high by social scientific standards, especially since
respondents were not paid or reimbursed in any way [ 13]. The
core dataset of 3,190 participants used in our analyses includes allparticipants for whom we have complete demographic data and
who responded to both the initial and follow-up surveys.
4.2 Measures
We test our hypotheses using a set of dichotomous independent
measures that we construct from the dataset shared with us by
CodeDay. Our dependent variable Continued is a dichotomous
measure of continued participation in coding that is set to 1 if a
user reported that they were still engaging in coding activities in
the 10-week postevent survey and 0 if the user reported that they
were not.
Our first key independent variable is NonMale and is assigned 0
for participants who reported their gender as Male and 1 for par-
ticipants who self-identified as Female, nonbinary, or other. While
we recognize that it is more common to code biological sex as
male/female/etc and gender identity as man/boy, woman/girl, and
nonbinary, we code “gender” as NonMale in our analyses for two
reasons: the survey asked for gender in terms of male, female, or
nonbinary, and we are interested in the experience of underrepre-
sented groups in general. We describe this as gender and not sex
because CodeDay staff explained to us that the survey was about
gender identity, not biological sex. We use a binary gender specifi-
cation for statistical inference purposes, not because we believe that
gender identity can be adequately represented as a binary. While
we chose to use the terms "Male" and NotMale" in our analysis,
rather than "Boy" and "NotBoy," it is important to recognize that
the subjects of our study are children. Our second key independent
variable is Non-White , with participants who identified as White
coded as 0 and all others coded as 1.
In addition to the overall demographic breakdown of our dataset,
we were also interested in the details of the demographic com-
position of events from the personal perspectives of individual
participants. Accordingly, for each individual attendee, we sepa-
rately calculated the proportion of other participants attending
each attendee’s CodeDay event who shared the focal individual’s
reported gender ( Gender Prop. ) and ethnicity ( Ethnicity Prop. ) and
used these proportions to test Hypothesis 2. Although these propor-
tions can theoretically range between 0 and 1, when we look only
at participants who provide demographics data, the large majority
of the data was between 0.1 and 0.3 for ethnicity and between 0.1
and 0.4 for gender.
To test Hypothesis 3, we constructed a measure, Presented , where
participants who presented were assigned 1 and those who did not
present were assigned 0. It is important to note that whether partic-
ipants presented was typically determined at the event level. The
large majority of participants in our dataset attended events where
all groups presented in some form (131 of 141 events) and each
attendee was recorded as having presented. That said, there was no
requirement for each member of the group to actively participate
in the presentation in these cases. At a further four events, none of
the participants presented, leaving only six events where whether
to present or not may have been offered as an option to attendees.
Coding Interest , used as a control variable, was also a dichoto-
mous measure. It was coded 1 when participants reported low prior
interest in coding and 0 when no prior interest was reported. Be-
cause we only have outcome data on participants who reportedHacking with Peers Koli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland

4.3 Analytic Plan
We first use descriptive statistics to understand the gender and
ethnicity distributions of the participants in CodeDay events. The
Python code we used to explore and visualize our data is available
in the online material accompanying this paper (link provided in
Appendix A). We then test all our hypotheses using multilevel lo-
gistic regression. Pampel [ 24] explains that while linear regression
is well suited to outcomes that are continuous, logistic regression
can be used to model differences in probability as log odds and is
well suited for dichotomous dependent variables, such as whether
or not an event takes place. Prior level of expressed coding inter-
est of the participants is used as a control variable across all our
analyses and is expected to be strongly associated with continued
participation. Because participants are clustered within events in a
way that might threaten the statistical assumption of independence
behind logistic regression, we fit generalized linear mixed-effects
regression models with a random intercept term ( 𝑢) associated with
each event. The R code that we used to evaluate our models is
available in the online material accompanying our paper.
4.3.1 Hypothesis 1: Demographics and persistence. Hypothesis 1
looks at the association between gender ( NonMale ) or ethnicity
(NonWhite ), separately, on continued participation in coding activi-
ties:
ForHypothesis 1a , we used the following model to assess the
effect of being nonmale:

ˆ𝑝(1−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)!
=ˆ𝛽0+ˆ𝛽1𝑁𝑜𝑛𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒+ˆ𝛽2𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡+𝑢
ForHypothesis 1b , we used the model below to assess the effect
of being non-White:

ˆ𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)
ˆ𝑝(1−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)!
=ˆ𝛽0+ˆ𝛽1𝑁𝑜𝑛𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑡𝑒+ˆ𝛽2𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡+𝑢
4.3.2 Hypothesis 2: Peer demographics and persistence. Hypoth-
esis 2 uses each individual as a reference point and looks at theassociation between the proportion of attendees who share simi-
lar demographics ( Gender Prop. andEthnicity Prop. ) and continued
participation in coding activities. Because we are particularly in-
terested in the ability of these events to broaden participation, we
present the tests of Hypothesis 2 both in general and among groups
stratified by NonMale andNonWhite . This allows us to see the effect
of demographic similarity between attendees among members of
underrepresented groups.
ForHypothesis 2a , we used the following model to assess the
effect of attending events with others who share the same self-
identified gender:
log 
ˆ𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)
ˆ𝑝(1−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)!
= ˆ𝛽0+ˆ𝛽1𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝.+

effect of attending events with others who share the same self-
identified ethnicity:

ˆ𝑝(1−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)!
= ˆ𝛽0+ˆ𝛽1𝐸𝑡ℎ𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝.+
ˆ𝛽2𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡+𝑢
4.3.3 Hypothesis 3: Presentation and persistence. In Hypothesis
3, we look at the association between presenting one’s work pub-
licly ( Presented ) and continued participation, combined with demo-
graphic measures.
InHypothesis 3a , we look at the association of presentation
and gender with continued activity in coding. We use two different
measures to look at the effect of gender. The first is a binary mea-
sure that indicates whether the attendee is of an underrepresented
gender group ( NonMale ), as in Hypothesis 1a. The second is our
measure of the proportion of attendees at the same event who share
the gender of the attendee ( Gender Prop. ), as in Hypothesis 2a. We
also consider the interaction between gender and presentation. OurKoli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland Emilia Gan, Tyler Menezes, and Benjamin Mako Hill
model for Hypothesis 3a is thus:
log 
ˆ𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)
ˆ𝑝(1−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)!
= ˆ𝛽0+ˆ𝛽1𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑+ˆ𝛽2𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡+
ˆ𝛽3𝑁𝑜𝑛𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒+ˆ𝛽4𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝.+
ˆ𝛽5𝑁𝑜𝑛𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒∗𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑+𝑢
Similarly, with Hypothesis 3b , we look at the association of
presenting and ethnicity using both a binary measure of ethnic-
ity (NonWhite ) and a measure of how many others attending the
event share the attendee’s self-identified ethnicity ( Ethnicity Prop ).
Therefore, our model for Hypothesis 3b is:
log 
ˆ𝑝(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)
ˆ𝑝(1−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑑)!
= ˆ𝛽0+ˆ𝛽1𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑+ˆ𝛽2𝐶𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡+

5 RESULTS
Tables 2 and 3 present a set of descriptive bivariate statistics from
the follow-up surveys sent to these attendees that capture the basic
patterns in our data. In these tables, we include data for nonrespon-
dents to the survey (the category “unknown” in the tables) and cal-
culate persistence percentages while both including and excluding
these unknowns. The combined category in each table is the same
and is provided for ease of comparison with the groupings that are
divided by gender (nonmale/male) or ethnicity (non-White/White).
When unknowns are left out, it should be noted that the proportions
of respondents in each subgroup that persisted in coding activities
after the event fall within a relatively narrow range, with a low of
62% (for the nonmale subgroup) and a high of 67.4% (for the White
subgroup).
As described in our Analytical Plan Section, coding interest was
included as a control variable in all our statistical analyses. Not
surprisingly, a higher level of prior coding interest—that is, “little”
interest, as opposed to “no” interest—was strongly associated with
a higher likelihood of continuing participation. Furthermore, as
can be seen in Tables 4 through 9, the coefficients associated with
coding interest fall within the range of 0.58–0.74, and within the
even narrower range of 0.64–0.69 for most analyses.
H1a looks at the relationship between gender and continued par-
ticipation. As shown in Table 4, we see that nonmale participants
are less likely to continue coding after the event than male partici-
pants. Table 5 shows the results of the analysis carried out to test
H1b, focusing on the relationship between ethnicity and continued
participation. Here, we see that non-White participants are less
likely to continue coding after the event than White participants.
Both results are as hypothesized.
In Tables 6 and 7, we see results of the analyses testing H2a and
H2b, which explore the effect of having others of the same gender
and ethnicity, respectively, at an event. Our results indicate that
attending events with others of the same gender is not significantly
associated with continued participation for either male or nonmale

participants. However, when considering ethnicity, having others
of the same ethnicity at the event was significantly associated with
increased likelihood of continued participation for non-White, but
not for White, attendees.
Table 8 presents the results of the analysis performed for H3a
focusing on gender. We see a negative association between NonMale
and continued participation that is consistent with our findings for
H1a. Although the effect of presenting on its own was not found to
be significant in the analysis for H3a, the result for the interaction
term indicates that presenting is significantly associated with a
higher likelihood of continued participation for nonmale attendees
who present their projects.
Table 9 presents the results of the analysis performed for H3a
focusing on ethnicity. We see support for the argument of H2b
that the presence of others of one’s own ethnicity is significantly
associated with continued participation. On the other hand, pre-
senting one’s project at the event appears to be associated with
a slightly lower likelihood of continuing to participate in coding
after the event. However, looking at the interaction term, we see
that the situation is not so straightforward. For attendees who are
non-White, presenting was associated with an increased likelihood
of continued participation. Although interesting, neither of these
last two findings is statistically significant.
Our findings for H3a (gender focus) are illustrated in Figure 2.
Our findings for H3b (ethnicity focus) are illustrated in Figure 3.
Hypothesis 3 explores the association between presenting at the
event and continued participation in coding. However, since the
models we use for H3 contain our ethnicity or gender variables as
well, this allows us to plug in different values for these variables and
plot the resulting predictions. The steps followed to produce these
plots are described in detail in the online materials accompanying
this paper. Both figures show model-predicted levels of continued
participation (our 𝑦axis) drawn from our models for prototypical
individuals with coding interest held at our sample mean and with
the proportion of attendees with similar gender or ethnicity varying
between the 10thand 90thpercentile in our sample (our 𝑥axis).
Figure 2 shows that, as we predicted in H1a, being nonmale is
associated with a decreased likelihood of continuing to participate
in coding after the event. Also in line with our prediction for H3a,Hacking with Peers Koli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland

presentation is associated with an increased likelihood of continu-
ing coding for attendees, regardless of gender. Furthermore, while
presenting is associated with higher levels of perseverance for all
attendees, the plot clearly displays that this effect is much more
significant for nonmale attendees. The downward slope evident
as the gender proportion increases is contrary to our prediction
for H2a, that attending events with others of similar gender wouldKoli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland Emilia Gan, Tyler Menezes, and Benjamin Mako Hill

be associated with increased persistence with coding. Although
this effect is interesting, it does not reflect a statistically significant
relationship.
Consider, for example, a prototypical nonmale participant who
attends an event where 20% of participants are also nonmale (indi-
cated by the dashed vertical line in the plot). If this hypothetical
person were to present, they would be predicted to have a probabil-
ity of continuing to code of 52.2%. However, if this participant did
not present, the predicted probability of continued coding drops to
just 30%. For a boy attending an event where 20% of the other atten-
dees are also boys, presenting would be associated with a predicted
probability of continued coding of 57.1%—not significantly higher
than the predicted probability of 53.5% had he not presented.
Figure 3 shows that, for participants who do not present (red
lines in Figure 3), White participants are consistently predicted to
continue coding at higher rates than non-White participants. This
is consistent with our prediction for H1b. However, this effect essen-
tially disappears when we compare White and non-White attendees
who presented their work. The predicted values for these attendees
create almost identical lines (blue lines in Figure 3). Looking still at
the effect of presenting, we see that while our prediction for H3b
held for non-White attendees, presenting among White attendees is
associated with a slightly decreased likelihood of continued codingin this group of attendees, contrary to our prediction. This rela-
tionship, although not statistically significant, is interesting, as it
suggests that presenting might eliminate any advantage that mem-
bership in a well-represented group provides to attendees. The plot
also clearly shows the positive association between attendees of
similar ethnicity and continued coding, supporting our prediction
for H2b.
Consider, for example, a prototypical non-White participant at-
tending an event where 20% of the other attendees are also non-
White. If this hypothetical person were to present, presenting would
be associated with a predicted probability of continued coding of
55.2%—higher than the predicted likelihood of 39.6%, had the par-
ticipant not presented. For a prototypical White participant who
attends an event where 20% of the participants are also White,
presenting is associated with a predicted likelihood of continued
coding of 55.8%, essentially the same probability as found for the
prototypical non-White participant. However, if this hypotheti-
cal White participant had not presented, the predicted probability
would have been 61.6 %.
6 DISCUSSION
Since its first 24-hour event in Seattle in 2011, close to 60,000 young
people have participated in nearly 500 CodeDay events [ 6]. Al-
though CodeDay is the only organization that we know of currently
hosting hackathons aimed at broadening participation among high
school age participants at this scale, we believe that this demon-
strates the potential of these hackathon-style events. But how well
does CodeDay actually meet its goal of engaging more underrep-
resented students in computing long-term? And what might the
organization do to be even more effective? We believe that our anal-
ysis offers insights into the characteristics of CodeDay events that
contribute to long-term participation in coding. We believe these
insights can be used in the organization of future events aimed at
broadening participation by many organizations.
6.1 Hypothesis 1: Demographics and persistence
In our test of H1, we find support for our predictions for both gen-
der and ethnicity: being nonmale or non-White is associated with
a lower likelihood of continued engagement. This is also apparent
in Tables 2 and 3 and is not surprising. Margolis and Fisher com-
prehensively described factors that contribute to gender inequality
in computing 20 years ago [ 17]. Margolis, with others, continued
to look at how education, race, and computing are intertwined,
making clear how long-standing societal inequality was reflected
in schools and limited access to the opportunities offered by com-
puting [ 19]. Their work both provides context and emphasizes the
relevance of current work around inequity in computing. Adoles-
cence is a critical period in identity formation—young people make
decisions about who they are and where they fit in [ 17,19]. Such
deliberations directly impact such decisions as college major. The
messages society sends to girls and members of ethnic minority
groups, starting in early childhood, have not changed much over
the years. Numerous programs have been established to introduce
young children to computing, including many designed specifically
for girls. Despite these efforts to counteract them, gender gaps are
stubbornly persistent.Hacking with Peers Koli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland
CodeDay seems to be seeing some promising results in their
efforts to actively recruit participants from underrepresented popu-
lations to many of their events and programs. Our demographic data
show that events are bringing in students from diverse backgrounds
including students who, for whatever reason, do not currently feel
connected to computing or see opportunities for themselves there.
We view the results related to event demographics illustrated in
Figure 1 as a hopeful sign. Furthermore, as seen in Tables 2 and 3,
although attendees who identify as nonmale continue at lower rates
than those who identify as male, and those who identify as non-
White continue at lower rates than those who identify as White,
the rates are not vastly different.
6.2 Hypothesis 2: Event demographics and
persistence
Looking at H2, we find partial support for our prediction that mem-
bers of a well-represented group might feel just as out of place as
members of a traditionally underrepresented group if attending
an event where few others shared their gender or ethnicity, and
that this would be reflected in lower persistence in coding after
the event. Our prediction seemed to be supported for both gender
and ethnicity. Looking closer at the effect for gender, however, we
see that the sign of the coefficient for Gender Prop. changes when
attendees are grouped as either nonmale or male (Table 6, last two
columns). This suggests that for both, when considered separately,
the likelihood of continued engagement decreases as the propor-
tion of other attendees who share the same gender identification
increases. This is contrary to our prediction.
As Figure 2 illustrates, nonmales continue at lower rates than
males. In this lower end of the range, their lower base levels for
continued engagement dominate. As we move to higher values
forGender Prop. , boys are overrepresented so their higher base
level of continued engagement dominates. This transition shows
how our combined model might mask the slight negative associa-
tion between Gender Prop. and continued engagement revealed by
our regression analysis. Although not statistically significant, the
possibility of this relationship is still thought provoking and fits
the observation made by Decker et al. that segregated events can
increase the sense of separation and exclusion from mainstream
computing culture [ 8]. We imagine that there might be some “sweet
spot,” where the gender distribution of an event benefits all atten-
dees.
When looking at ethnicity, we find that attending events with
others of one’s own ethnicity is associated with a greater likelihood
of continued participation for both non-White and White attendees.
However, the result for White attendees was not statistically sig-
nificant. We speculate that this could be because White attendees
are not subject to the same level of self-doubt about whether or not
they belong in computing, given that the computing workforce is
predominantly White. Another contributing factor could be that
White attendees are not subject to the daily stress of surviving in a
society that is not structured to include them and do not have to deal
with microaggressions attendees from other ethnic backgrounds
may have to contend with. Consequently, White attendees at an
event where many others look like them might barely notice this
fact. For attendees who are not used to thinking of computing as awelcoming space for people like them, seeing others from similar
ethnic backgrounds at CodeDay events could be both surprising
and positively motivating.
6.3 Hypothesis 3: Presentation and persistence
Finally, for H3, we find partial support for our predictions. When
looking at presentation in combination with ethnicity (Table 9), we
did not see a significant impact of presentation alone. However, it is
interesting to note that the coefficient for presentation is negative,
suggesting a slightly decreased likelihood of continued participa-
tion, while the interaction term of ethnicity and presentation is
positive. This suggests that presenting could be associated with a
slightly lower likelihood of continued participation for White atten-
dees who present and a somewhat higher likelihood of continued
participation for non-White attendees who do so. In this model, in-
creasing the proportion of others of the same ethnicity was found to
be significantly associated with increased participation, regardless
of presentation (as hypothesized in H2b).
6.4 Future Directions
As is often the case, our findings have raised new questions that
warrant further exploration. The influences that determine whether
or not someone decides to engage in coding are dynamic, interact-
ing, and complex to elucidate. Our current study has provided a
partial view of these influences, but much remains to be studied and
understood. After completing this analysis, we hope researchers
will investigate the following questions: 1) What motivates partici-
pants expressing low or no prior interest in coding to attend these
events? 2) What structural features of these events do participants
find most helpful and influential in how they perceive coding and
computing? 3) What does long-term participation look like? and
4) What impact does intersectionality have in how participants
experience the event and in their long-term coding persistence?
The dataset we used provides a historical record of CodeDay’s
success at reaching young people from diverse backgrounds. Our
quantitative analysis strongly suggests that the diversity of events
contributes to the success of these events as measured by long-
term persistence in coding. Of course, our quantitative analysis
cannot reveal rich insights into the motivations or experiences of
individual attendees. Cheryan et al. have demonstrated the impor-
tance of environment in creating a sense of belonging [ 5]. Although
CodeDay staff have worked hard to create an environment that
will be perceived as welcoming and safe by all participants, to date
they have not been able to assess what elements of events are most
critical to achieving this goal. To explore the subjective experiences
of attendees, we hope to conduct a mixed methods study of this
population in the future. In addition to collecting survey data at dif-
ferent time points, we hope to also conduct observations of events
and interviews of participants. This approach has the potential to
provide valuable information on how young people view coding
and their place in computing at a critical decision-making point in
their lives.
7 LIMITATIONS
Because event attendees were not required to provide demographic
data, no data was available for 48.7% of the attendees. It is possibleKoli 2022, November 17–20, 2022, Koli, Finland Emilia Gan, Tyler Menezes, and Benjamin Mako Hill
that had we been able to include demographics for these partici-
pants, our results would be different. We believe our Gender Prop.
andEthnicity Prop. measures are most likely to be affected by not
having complete demographics data because some individual events
had large numbers of attendees who did not provide demographics
data. We are encouraged that in spite of this, we are still able to
see correlations between event demographics and persistence. We
plan to conduct qualitative studies in the future to assess the large-
scale trends identified in this work and to understand individual
participant motivations.
Another possible threat to the validity of our findings stems
from the fact that no data on the age of the attendees was collected.
Therefore, we cannot evaluate the effect age has on presenting
and/or continuing coding and possible interactions between age
and other variables in the analysis. It is possible that the event
format might affect different age groups to different degrees, es-
pecially as older attendees may have had more experience with
coding. Although age data are not available, we know that most of
CodeDay’s events were publicized to high school students and that
most of the attendees came from this age group. Additionally, we
expect that college students who may have attended events tended
to be more interested in coding because they would have needed to
specifically seek out the events. In these cases, they would not have
been included in our analysis because follow-up surveys were only
sent to those attendees who expressed little or no prior interest in
coding. Consequently, we would not expect the analysis to change
significantly if age data were available and feel comfortable that
our analysis adequately represents the age group of interest (high
schoolers).
Considering the importance of role models and mentors, we
should also acknowledge that mentor demographics could influence
attendees’ motivation to continue coding and the development of a
sense of belonging in computing. Although approximately 60% of
the students in the dataset (for whom demographics were available)
were members of a population underrepresented in computing, it
is estimated that only about a quarter of CodeDay’s mentors are
[20]. Because CodeDay mentors are typically software engineers
recruited from local companies, the diversity of mentors often
reflects the low diversity in the computer industry. No demographic
data was collected from events about mentors.
A final threat concerns the external validity of our results and
the degree to which our results generalize to other hackathons. As
hackathons have become more popular, efforts have been made
to make events more welcoming and diverse [ 26]. We believe that
our results will generalize better to such hackathons than to more
traditional hackathon events. Our data are also specific to the United
States, a country with its own unique issues around diversity and
inclusion, which may limit the generalizability of our findings.
8 CONCLUSION
Given the historically low number of women and people of color in
computing, great efforts have been made to broaden participation.
For designers of hackathon-style events seeking to address this
inequality, our findings indicate that working to promote diversity
in participant ethnicity might be as important and at least as suc-
cessful. In the context of this study, attending events with others ofthe same gender did not have the same impact on persistence in
coding as attending events with others of the same ethnicity. Our
findings should be of interest to educators and others seeking to
promote inclusivity and diversity.
