ABSTRACT 
Misconceptions surrounding disability and sexuality are still preva-
lent and people with disabilities are often depicted as asexual and 
incapable to lead fulflling sex lives. As a result, many individuals 
with disabilities struggle to access adequate sex education with 
negative consequences such as unplanned pregnancies, body image 
issues and sexual exploitation. To explore needs and practices for 
accessing relevant and reliable information about disability and 
sexuality, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 partici-
pants. Results show that there are several topics which participants 
thought should be better explored in the context of disability and 
sexuality, but most available sex education resources are not in-
clusive. Moreover, people with disabilities, especially when young 
or less used to self-advocate for their own needs, face difculties 
engaging in meaningful conversations around sexuality. Based on 
the results of our research, we make recommendations for areas 
where HCI research could signifcantly contribute to make intimate 
interactions more accessible.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Sex and sexuality are often severely overlooked topics in much of 
the disability discourse [30]. For decades, silence on the topic was 
accompanied by oppression and brutal practices, such as forced 
sterilization, causing severe shame and trauma for many people 
with
 disabilities. As stated by Shakespeare 2000, “Sexuality, for

disabled people, has been an area of distress, and exclusion, and self-
doubt for so long, that it was sometimes easier not to consider it, 
than to engage with everything from which so many were excluded.” 
[31]. In more recent years, scholars and activists have been strongly 
arguing for more research on the topic and for a change in discourse 
towards sexual liberation for people with disabilities [18]. However, 
frsthand accounts of how people with disabilities negotiate access 
to sex, intimacy and relationships, and the barriers they face are 
still lacking [32]. 
Previous research has observed that amongst youth with disabil-
ities, similarly to their peers without disabilities, many leverage the 
internet to form relationships, express their sexualities, consume 
sexual content and access information [8]. Nonetheless, it is un-
clear what other strategies and sources of information about sex 
and sexuality were used by young people beyond the internet and 
various social media. 
In this paper, we present the results of a semi-structured inter-
view study involving fve participants with diferent disabilities that 
aim to understand how they accessed relevant information about 
sex and sexuality (both through digital and non-digital means), 
which sex education topics they thought were most important for 
people with disabilities, which ones were more often overlooked, 
and what they identifed as the most relevant barriers to more in-
clusive sex education. Based on our results we present a series of 
recommendations for how future HCI research could contribute to 
the development of more inclusive resources for sex education that 
could address the needs of people with disabilities. 
2 RELATED WORK 
Previous research investigating the perceptions of diferent groups, 
from healthcare providers and the general public to people with 
disabilities themselves, has uncovered that many individuals with 
disabilities are often victim of incorrect stereotypes and stigmati-
zation that portrays them as asexual, infantiliesed and unable to 
lead full and satisfactory sex lives, particularly with a partner who 
does not have a disability [12]. This aligns with the theory of sexual 
script that describes sexuality as a social process shaped by one’s 
internalized belief of how sexual behaviors should be played out, 
often following highly stereotypical genderized norms [5]. These 
external misconceptions are extremely damaging, afecting both 
physical and mental well-being of people with disabilities [28] . Sex-
ual stigma may afect confdence, desire, and one’s ability to fnd 
a partner. At the same time, these social and cultural barriers can 
lead to internalized misrepresentations ranging from confusions 
about one’s sexual identity, reduced-self-esteem and doubts about 
asexuality [28].CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA Giulia Barbareschi and Zhouzhe Wu 
Many of these stereotypes are perpetrated by ableist public im-
agery and a severe lack of sex education resources that touch upon 
the topic of disability or, even more rarely, feature inclusive mate-
rial about disability and sexuality [4, 5]. As a result, people with 
disabilities often struggle to access comprehensive and relevant 
information about sex and sexuality, which could empower them 
to live more fulflling, safe and pleasurable sex lives [1, 9]. Coupled 
with the reduced independence experienced by many people with 
disabilities, this lack of knowledge increases the risks of sufering 
from violence and abuse and other potentially harmful sexual conse-
quences, including unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted 
diseases [13, 17, 25, 29]. 
Another factor that make it signifcantly more difcult for peo-
ple with disabilities, in particular young people with disabilities, 
to engage in conversations about sex and sexuality, is that parents, 
educators, and even health professionals, often feel uncomfortable 
or unprepared to discuss sexual issues or provide advice [9]. Find-
ings from East & Orchards interviews with young people with 
physical disabilities, their parents and health professionals reveal a 
complex web of embarrassment and unpreparedness which results 
in a constant struggle to “push away the issue ” from both parents 
and healthcare professionals. Common excuses used to justify this 
behavior were arguing that it was either not yet the time for dis-
cussions about sex and sexuality, or that such a discussion should 
be led by someone with more experience than themselves. The 
result was that young people would rarely receive comprehensive 
information about sex [9]. 
Over the years, both researchers and practitioners have devel-
oped and deployed a number of interventions to promote better 
sexual education amongst people with disabilities [ 26, 27, 33]. For 
example, a computer-based interactive multimedia program that 
aimed to reduce risk of HIV transmission amongst women with 
intellectual disability was shown to be efective in increasing knowl-
edge of HIV, willingness to use condom, and engage in safe sex 
related behaviors [33]. Wells et al also observed that the use of 
interactive technology increased the accessibility of the material 
for participants who had limited literacy [33]. 
However, reviews exploring the content of various interventions 
delivering sexual education to people with disabilities highlight 
that the majority of the topics centered around health aspects, 
self-awareness, safety, and biological matters (such as puberty and 
menstruation), largely overlooking other topics that were impor-
tant to users such as information about pleasure, relationships, and 
personal sexuality [23, 26]. Conversely, the discourse analysis car-
ried out by Hall 2018 [14], who examined the conversation amongst 
members of a disability specifc forum, reveals that topics that drew 
most engagement from individuals ranged from practical matters 
such as advice on experimenting with diferent sexual positions to 
vulnerable conversations around relationships, pleasure, desire and 
intimacy. 
Ultimately, as highlighted by Schaafsma et al. 2017 [ 25], regard-
less of the medium used to deliver sex education programmes and 
interventions, people with disabilities were rarely involved in their 
development. To this end, it is important to explore how individual 
with disabilities currently access information about sex and sexu-
ality, what information they deem important, and how they think 
sex educational content could be made accessible more efectively. 3 METHODS 
3.1 Interviews 
From the brief literature review presented in the previous section, 
it is evident that there are many signifcant barriers that hinder the 
ability of people with disabilities to access sex education content and 
information that might empower them to achieve a more fulflling 
sexual life. To gain a better understanding of which information 
about sex and sexuality people with disabilities are interested in 
acquiring and what are the current difculties that they encounter 
in accessing them, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 
fve participants [P1 - P5]. These fve participants reported diferent 
ages, backgrounds and disabilities as referenced in Table 1. Two 
participants were from the UK, one from the US, one from Canada 
and one from South Africa. Self-reported age ranged between 23 
and 48. Two participants identifed as female, two as male and one 
as non-binary. 
Participants were recruited through social media, relevant mail-
ing lists and forums targeting people with disabilities. Inclusion 
criteria for the study were age above 18, self-identify as a person 
with disability, and ability to provide informed consent to take 
part in the study. As the study was conducted during the COVID-
19 pandemic, all interviews were carried out remotely using the 
video-conferencing software Microsoft Teams. This platform was 
preferred to other alternatives as it ofers enhanced security and 
better data protection options compared to other similar software. 
After the conclusion of the data collection, participants were entered 
in a draw for two 25£vouchers to thank them for their participation. 
The interview was structured around three main subsections. In 
the initial part of the interview participants were asked about their 
knowledge and opinion of current practices in the delivery of sex 
education, what they considered reliable sources of information 
already available across diferent domains and what mechanisms 
could be used to access them, who they though people with disabil-
ities where more likely to approach if they had questions related 
to their own sex lives, and what barriers and facilitators might 
afect people with disabilities’ ability to obtain reliable information 
concerning sex and sexuality. In the second part of the interview, 
participants were asked their opinion about the importance of in-
cluding a variety of topics into what could become a “blueprint 
for an inclusive sex education programme”. These topics included 
contraception, sexually health, masturbation, puberty and sexu-
ality, pregnancy and conception, inclusive sex toys, consent and 
communication. Participants were also asked to suggest any other 
topic that they deemed important. Finally, in the third part of the 
interview, participants were asked about their opinion on what role 
technology is currently playing in access to sex related information, 
how could it be better leveraged to improve access to inclusive in-
formation about sex and sexuality, what advantages could ofer over 
non-technological means, and what limitations and safeguarding 
mechanisms would need to be considered. 
It is important to notice that to protect participants’ privacy 
and to avoid the disclosure of potentially sensitive information, 
participants were never asked about their personal experiences 
in relation to sex and sexuality, but rather their expert opinions 
on what knowledge and information about sex and sexuality are 
important for people with disabilities in general.Accessing Intimate Interactions: Investigating the need for More Inclusive Sex Education Resources CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA

The length of the interviews varied between 35 and 70 minutes. 
Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Tran-
scripts were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis to elicit 
emergent themes [3]. Both authors conducted the initial coding sep-
arately using the NVivo 12 Software, codes were discussed by the 
two authors and themes were conceptualized through consensus. 
4 RESULTS 
Three main themes were identifed from the interview data: “The 
pitfalls of prejudice, shame and ignorance ”, “The importance of having 
someone to talk to”, “No topic is of the table ”, we unpack each of 
them in the sub-sections below. 
4.1 The pitfalls of prejudice, shame and 
ignorance 
All participants stated that access to sex education programs and/or 
relevant information about sex and sexuality is severely limited for 
most people with disabilities. Only P3 was aware of dedicated sex 
education been provided by occupational therapists to individuals 
who had a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), as part of comprehensive reha-
bilitation programmes in the UK. All other participants were not 
aware of sex education programmes, inclusive or specifcally tar-
geted to people with disabilities, that were delivered by any “ofcial 
channels”, such as government national health systems, charities 
or within schools. Participants agreed that one of the main root 
causes of this shortcoming is that people with disabilities are seen 
by most as asexual. 
“It’s the stigma of disability. They think disabled peo-
ple cannot be found sexual or beautiful at all because 
they are disabled.” – P4 
“We are just seen as children. Yeah . . . I mean it is ei-
ther children or inspirations, you know. We are never 
seen as just people.” – P3 
When referring to the possibility of a sex education class being 
ofered in a mainstream school, which all but one described as an 
unlikely event in most schools, participants were adamant that any 
pupil with disability would be automatically excluded from it. 
“Sex education is mostly ignored in school anyway. 
But if it wasn’t a disabled person would be excluded 
from the class because it’s not for them, or they would 
be in the class, but they wouldn’t have anything di-
rected at them you know” – P5 
Even if one was to proactively seek out information about dis-
ability and sexuality, this would likely be a difcult and lonely quest. 
Many young people with disabilities are often surrounded by peers, teachers, friends and family members who do not have a disabil-
ity. Most of the people within their social circles lack the relevant 
knowledge to provide factual information, have little shared expe-
riences and, especially in the case of parents, feel embarrassed and 
ashamed to even begin conversations about what is considered a 
“taboo topic”. 
“Being born disabled in non-disabled family, you are 
just an outsider. And there is also no sharing tips and 
tricks and tools in schools if you go to mainstream.” – 
P1 
Shame and embarrassment were not seen as being exclusive to 
parents or other family members without disabilities. Participants 
believed that many individuals with disabilities themselves might 
feel uncomfortable about attending a sex education course, and 
potentially be reluctant to take part even if the opportunity was 
ofered to them. 
“I am not sure if many people with disabilities I know 
would feel ok going to a sex education class in per-
son. I think they would be afraid of meeting local 
witnesses . . . People that they know. You don’t want 
to let other know that not everything is ok in that 
area” – P2 
4.2 The importance of having someone to talk to 
Participants felt that most people with disabilities were left alone 
in their quest to obtain information about sex and sexuality. P4 and 
P1 believed that many people with disabilities might beneft from 
being able to receive support from a therapist or a counselor with 
the right kind of expertise. However, P5 highlighted how access to 
these services can be quite expensive, making it an unfeasible option 
for most people with disabilities. This will be especially challenging 
for those who are young and might be fnancially depend on their 
parents, or simply lack a stable source of income. Moreover, P2 and 
P3 stated that therapists or counselors with relevant expertise, and 
who have an inclusive outlook towards sexuality, can be extremely 
rare and difcult to fnd. Finally, the prominent stigma surrounding 
disability and sexuality in many countries might make individuals 
with disabilities reluctant to approach an unknown professional for 
fear of being dismissed or shamed. 
“I feel like there is a lot of barrier towards the way 
that professionals see disabled people and treat dis-
abled people don’t have that sort of relationship or 
communication where people might feel comfortableCHI ’22 Extended Abstracts, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA Giulia Barbareschi and Zhouzhe Wu 
talking about that in this country. I know in other 
countries it’s a lot diferent.” – P3 
As parents, teachers, and even qualifed professionals were not 
seen as a potential point of contact for accessing information about 
sex, participants felt that most people with disabilities were likely 
to rely on friends, especially the ones who were also persons with 
disabilities, to ask questions or simply discuss sexuality related 
topics that were important to them. Nonetheless, participants stated 
that many people with disabilities might not have friends with 
similar experiences in their immediate circles, hence they would 
be likely to rely on virtual communities or forums. 
“I think in terms of friends, it’s difcult for people 
with disabilities because you might approach them 
with questions because friends are more likely to talk 
about sex. But if they don’t share the same disability 
as you, then they might not have the information that 
you need for it. I would say, the frst approach would 
probably be online, like Googling things and asking 
in the community online.”- P5 
Overall, participants described online resources as extremely 
useful, and often downright essential for most people with disabili-
ties. Forums, blogs, online videos and other platforms didn’t just 
enable people to access information about sex that would other-
wise be difcult to fnd, but also allowed people to ask questions 
anonymously when they might be too embarrassed to ask them in 
person. 
“Yeah, medical staf or other people can judge you, 
but computers can’t judge you” – P4 
At the same time, participants stated that many of the resources 
which are available online are of poor quality and might contain 
incorrect information that might be misleading and harmful for the 
individual. For example, P1 highlighted how many young people 
might gain sexual knowledge through pornography. While on the 
one hand, pornography featuring people with disabilities can be 
seen as liberating as it helps to shatter incorrect beliefs, it could 
also be exploitative, extremely damaging for mental health, and 
promoting unrealistic ideals of sexual performance. To help people 
flter content, learn to evaluate information, and obtain personalized 
support when needed P2 suggested that a blended approach could 
provide the best solutions for many individuals with disabilities. 
“I think that education should not only be digital, it 
should also be face to face with maybe health prac-
titioners, doctors, teachers, and other persons with 
disabilities as well! – P2 
4.3 There shouldn’t be any topic which is of 
the table 
As part of the interview, we asked participants to mention any topic 
or area of interest that an inclusive sex education programme should 
feature. Their response was extremely varied and highlighted the 
need for tailored approaches to provide information concerning 
sex and sexuality in relation to topics tackled, disability-specifc 
facts and means of delivering the actual content. Some topics, such 
as contraception, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and masturbation were seen as universally important regardless of the 
age, disability, gender and sexual orientation of the individual. 
“Teaching about masturbation to all is really impor-
tant. It’s very important to recognize that people have 
diferent types of bodies and diferent ways that they 
can use their bodies and like diferent methods that 
they might explore their bodies with. – P5 
“Contraception is crucially important. Having a child 
accidentally is awful, which still happen today in Eng-
land for people with disabilities, because they have 
not been told about it” – P1 
Other topics were seen as being more specifc to people with 
diferent characteristics. For example, matters such as puberty and 
aging in relation to sex and disability could be tailored to people 
depending on their age. Similarly, specifc information about preg-
nancy, conception and genital hygiene care might be relevant to 
people with conditions that present particular challenges. Con-
versely, other topics might be relevant depending on the sexual 
preferences of the individual such as information pertaining BDSM 
practices or the use of sex toys. 
“Pregnancy is a strange thing, both a risk and a very 
good thing, depending on where you are in life. It 
is also important to know the risk to have a child 
and responsibilities and how conception works for 
someone with a physical disability” – P3 
“Yes, this one [genital hygiene care] is very important 
because you also have to know about a catheter, and 
you have to be very careful when it comes to yeast 
infections because you can get those from a sexual 
activities and you don’t want that to interfere with 
your catheter if you have to have one. – P4 
Another topic that all participants felt is currently largely over-
looked by most sex education resources, but is extremely important 
to people with disabilities, was related to communication and con-
sent. Firstly, this was considered essential as participants felt that 
people with disabilities might often be more vulnerable to sexual ex-
ploitation. Secondly, many participants with disabilities might have 
sexual relationships with someone who does not have a disability 
or has a diferent disability. This might lead to diferent needs and 
desires that one should be able to communicate with their partner. 
“Consent is an interesting thing because a lot of dis-
abled people get touched personally by carers or oth-
ers that are there to help. But that can lead you know 
that can lead very easily to abuse. Yeah, and then we 
need to give disabled people the tools to understand 
the good from the bad, the right from the wrong and 
give them the tools to communicate when some when 
they do feel that something is wrong or of or what-
ever and you know to make them feel comfortable.” – 
P3 
Finally, participants also highlighted how, although people with 
diferent types of disabilities might have specifc needs and interests 
that need to be addressed in a tailored manner, more general topics 
of sex education that are relevant to all should be provided in anAccessing Intimate Interactions: Investigating the need for More Inclusive Sex Education Resources CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA 
inclusive manner to help reduce misconceptions and favor a shared 
understanding between people with and without disabilities. 
“I would love for sex education to be available for all 
people with all disabilities, as inclusive as it can be. But 
that it doesn’t exclude people without disabilities from 
looking at it. Because I’m very . . . I really like creating 
sex education material that applies to everybody, but 
that everybody needs to see . . . Like even thinking 
back to grade school when they would split up the 
boys and the girls and they would teach the girls about 
periods and men have no idea how a period works . . .” 
– P5 
5 DISCUSSION 
The fndings from this study highlight some of the key challenges 
faced by people with disabilities in accessing sex education and 
obtaining relevant information related to sex and sexuality. The 
study also helps to uncover current practices used by people with 
disabilities to independently acquire sexual knowledge and address 
personal queries. Finally, the results identify areas of interests for 
inclusive sex education resources and suggests strategies for more 
efective delivery of content. 
Many of the challenges mentioned by participants in our study 
resonates with what has been reported in the literature [19]. The 
infantilization of people with disabilities that was often mentioned 
by participants, especially common amongst parents, teachers and 
careers is in line with what reported by Santos & Santos 2018 [24] 
and Carter et al 2021 [6]. As shown by Liddiard and Slater 2018 
[16], participants in our study also hinted at how the normative 
views of beauty and sexuality causes the systemic exclusion of dis-
abled bodies from mainstream sex related media, from educational 
content to pornography, which trickles down to individual views 
of who can, and cannot be, sexual amongst professionals, parents, 
potential partners and people with disabilities themselves. 
Previous scholars, including Ebrahim 2019 [ 11], have made the 
case that technology in the form web-based resources that promote 
more diverse and uncensored representation of sex and disability, 
including disability specifc pornography, can help to shatter pre-
conception and have a signifcantly liberating efect. P1 expressed 
a somehow similar view, highlighting both positive and negative 
aspects of pornographic material featuring people with disability, 
which include the risks of othering of disabled bodies and the ex-
ploitation of actors with disabilities. Moreover, P1 pointed out how 
pornographic content can often create unrealistic ideals of sexual 
performance amongst young people with disabilities as seen for 
their peers without disabilities [15]. These tensions highlight how 
technology might work as a gateway to access more diverse and 
inclusive representation of sexuality that can help bring down barri-
ers that are ableist, heteronormative and patriarchal [24]. However, 
there needs to be signifcant attention dedicated to ensuring that 
technology isn’t merely leveraged to promote exploitative content 
or facilitate abusive practices [10, 21]. 
As a person with disability might struggle to fnd someone with 
whom they can share experiences and have honest conversations 
about sex within their immediate social circles, our fndings also 
suggest that technology could help to facilitate these conversations amongst people with disabilities through dedicated groups [20]. 
Furthermore, technology can also support people with disabilities 
in gaining access to professionals with specifc expertise, who might 
not otherwise be available within their own area. One interesting 
aspect of technology mediated communication that participants 
identifed, is the perceived layer of anonymity that it ofers to users, 
which might make one more likely to ask questions without feeling 
shame or embarrassment. However, it is essential for any commu-
nity where members share questions and experiences about sex to 
be a safe space from predatory or abusive behaviors of any kind, 
but also secure from any potential inappropriate or exploitative use 
of highly sensitive data. Previous studies from Bennett 2017 [2] and 
Porter et al 2017 [22], highlighted some of the practices used by 
individuals with disabilities to shield themselves from unwanted 
contact when it came to dating websites and applications, but it is 
unclear if people with disabilities use similar strategies in online 
communities where they might exchange information about their 
own sexual lives. 
Participants also highlighted the need for technology to help 
identify and flter resources with information about disability and 
sex according to one’s needs and interests. From universally rele-
vant content that should be promoted for all to facilitate inclusive 
sex education, to specifc topics of interest that might be key for 
some individuals but less important to others, technology should 
enable users to identify the resources that match their need at a 
particular time. For these information to be truly accessible, it is 
paramount to ensure that valuable resources that can facilitate in-
clusive sex education are made available in a variety of formats, 
to address the needs of individuals with diferent capabilities and 
learning styles. 
Finally, researchers and designers should strive to better un-
derstand how efective existing and future technologies are in im-
proving one’s sexual well-being. Previous research by Cormier & 
O’Sullivan 2021[7], showed that almost a third of young adults ac-
cess sex technologies with the goal of improving their own sex lives. 
However, access to sex technologies was linked with overall lower 
self-reported sexual functioning. Ultimately, although technology 
might have the potential to make sex education more accessible, 
more efort needs to be invested in understanding its role and fnd-
ing optimal ways to ensure it promotes the sexual wellbeing of all 
users in an inclusive manner. 
6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper helps to further our understanding of the barriers that 
people with disabilities face when seeking to acquire relevant 
knowledge and information about sex and sexuality, uncovering 
existing practices, and highlighting needs and possibilities for the 
development of more inclusive sex education resources. The re-
sults from the interview study points at how many of the existing 
barriers are linked to incorrect representation of people with disabil-
ities which perpetrates ignorance, prejudice and stigma, including 
self-stigma. Participants stated how it is important for people with 
disabilities to be able to ask questions and share experiences with 
others, but pointed out to the difculties of doing so, as many within 
their immediate social circles might be unable to provide support. 
Finally, when discussing topics which they considered importantCHI ’22 Extended Abstracts, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA 
for the development of more inclusive sex education resources, 
participants pointed out how some topics should be seen as uni-
versally relevant also for people without disabilities as they would 
help to dispel misconceptions and promote a shared understand-
ing. Through our refections we highlight some key implication for 
how technology could become a vital tool to facilitate better ac-
cess to information for individual with disabilities and promote the 
liberation of sexual content from dominant ableist narrative. How-
ever, we suggest that there is a need to remain mindful of potential 
counterproductive efects of technology being used consciously or 
unconsciously to reinforce stereotypes or facilitate abusive prac-
tices. To further investigate how technology could be leveraged to 
facilitate access to information about sex and sexuality for persons 
with disabilities, we plan to conduct co-design workshops with 
participants with disabilities to develop novel ideas supporting the 
delivery of inclusive sex education.
