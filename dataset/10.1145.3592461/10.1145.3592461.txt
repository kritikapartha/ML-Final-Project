Islamic Geometry-Based  
Moon-Period Calendar  
and Interaction Design
Anuradha Reddy
Shocked by the recent 
overturning of Roe v. Wade  
by the U.S. Supreme Court, 
people who menstruate 
worldwide were advised 
to back up, delete, and 
hide their period data 
from mobile apps, doctors, 
and partners—data 
that could incriminate 
people for exercising 
privacy around fetal 
viability and their right 
to abortion. And just like 
that, decades of struggle 
and hard-earned progress 
is replaced by profound 
fears of patriarchal state 
control over female bodies. I am angry and I cannot 
let the stifling narratives 
about periods and the 
predictive data practices 
around them define how I 
visualize and perceive my 
body’s rhythms. Menstrual 
rhythms, which are as mundane as the moon as it 
cycles through its phases, 
have once again become 
a thing to be suppressed, 
go unmarked, and not 
exist unless they serve a 
reproductive purpose.
Raised in South India, 
I am not unfamiliar with 
hushed period-tracking 
etiquettes. They are passed 
down from grandmothers 
to mothers to daughters 
and between girlfriends 
and cousins, each offering 
advice about the myriad 
ways of tracking menstrual 
cycles. My cousins, for 
instance, are accustomed 
• Seeing my period days 
overlap with the moon 
phases on a visual matrix 
gives me a sense of when 
my next cycle will arrive. 
In this image, my period 
coincides with the third 
quarter of the moon, so 
I predict my future cycle 
happening a row above it, 
approximating near the 
next full moon. This way, I 
use my self-knowledge to 
reprogram the calendar 
and prepare for the 
following months’ cycles. 
Accuracy is not crucial, 
as I’m the only person 
programming and using 
the device, in the privacy  
of my home.
Menstrual 
rhythms have 
once again 
become a  
thing to be 
suppressed.

•  A code snippet for a 
single month’s trackingrest to the menstruating 
body, my younger self 
found this familial custom 
conservative and biased. I 
did everything to hide my 
period and avoid being in 
my family’s gaze. Thank 
you, period-tracking mobile 
apps , I thought.
Fast-forward to the 
present. How did we end 
up in a situation where 
having (or not having) a 
period puts menstruating 
bodies at the risk of legal 
prosecution, driven by 
the same technologies 
that benefit some of 
us with privacy from to following religious lunar 
calendars. If a religious 
day (e.g., a no moon day) 
coincides with their 
menstrual cycles, they 
refrain from worshipping 
on those days, which 
helps them keep track. 
At the same time, for the 
closest family members, 
it is noticeable when, on 
occasion, mothers and 
daughters don’t join a 
routine temple visit or 
set foot in the kitchen 
(considered sacred). Even 
if one were excused from 
doing household chores

traditions? Certainly I am 
not suggesting a return to 
how it was, but I believe 
there are more-than-
human values in the lunar 
calendar example waiting 
to be explored in the 
entanglements between 
different data, bodies, 
and naturally occurring 
cycles. Even still, I would 
like my period data to 
be local, private, and 
undisclosed to those who 
can cause harm by making 
decisions about what I’m (not) allowed to access and 
do with my body and its 
data.
I decided to experiment 
with a data visualization 
project of a moon phase and 
period-tracking calendar 
based on Islamic geometry 
patterns. Playing with 
Islamic geometry’s cyclical 
and geometric elements has 
made it a joy to speculate 
on my body’s rhythms and 
the moon’s cycles each 
month through making 
and coding, the process 
for which I describe here. I also point out that I’m 
not pursuing any pseudo-
theory that syncs moon 
phases with menstrual 
cycles. But it’s interesting 
to put the two cycles next 
to each other and marvel 
at them, individually and 
together!

• The printed circuit board 
is made by the Swedish 
company Solder Party. Each 
circular unit of 10 LEDs is 
programmed as a single 
unit. There are 30 units in 
total (6” x 5” grid) for 30 days 
in a month (lunar months 
always alternate between 29 
and 30 days).
• The calendar uses the 
RP2040 Stamp Round 
Carrier board with 
CircuitPython to program 
the LEDs in delectable 
twilight colors (#330019, 
period; #190033, moon).
