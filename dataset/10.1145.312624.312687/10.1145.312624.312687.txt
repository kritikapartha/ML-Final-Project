Lac k of e/#0Bectiv eness app ears toha v e three causes/. First/, collection selection based on w ordhistograms is not appropriate for heterogeneous collections/.
Second/, relev an t do cumen ts are scattered o v er man y collec/-tions and searc hing a few collections misses man y relev an tdo cumen ts/. Third/, most existing collection selection met/-rics lac k sound theoretical justi/#0Ccations and hence ma y notbe w ell tuned to the problem/. W e prop ose a new approac hto distributed retriev al based on do cumen t clustering andlanguage mo deling/. Do cumen t clustering is used to orga/-nize collections around topics/. Language mo deling is usedto prop erly represen t topics and e/#0Bectiv ely select the righ ttopics for a query /. Based on these ideas/, three metho ds areprop osed to suit di/#0Beren te n vironmen ts/. W e sho w that allthree metho ds impro v e e/#0Bectiv eness of distributed retriev al/./1 Intro ductionInformation has b ecome highly distributed and will b e ev enmore so in the future/. The W orld Wide W eb/, for example/,already consists of millions of w eb sites and the n um be r o fsites k eeps gro wing b y thousands eac hd a y /. It is ine/#0Ecien tand ma y b ecome imp ossible to construct a cen tral index forsuc h a h uge information system/. Designing algorithms toe/#0Ecien tly and e/#0Bectiv ely organize/, represen t and searc h dis/-tributed collections is one of the most signi/#0Ccan tc hallengesfacing Information Retriev al /#28IR/#29 researc h/.There ha v e b een man y studies ab out distributed retriev alin the IR/, digital library /, database and W orld Wide W ebcomm unities /#5B/2/, /2/3 /, /6/, /8/, /2/2/#5D/. A critical problem in dis/-tributed retriev al is collection selection/. Because a dis/-tributed retriev al system ma y consist of a large n um be r o fcollections/, the only w a y to ensure timely and economic re/-triev al is to searc h a small n um b er of collections whic h arelik ely to con tain relev an t do cumen ts for a query /. Collectionselection is critical for retriev al accuracy for the simple rea/-son that searc hing the wrong collections con taining few orno relev an t do cumen ts will result in retriev al failure for a
query /. The other problem is ho w to merge the retriev al re/-sults from di/#0Beren t collections/. In our opinion/, result merg/-ing/, though imp ortan t/, is a secondary issue/. Callan et alsho w ed that simple normalizations of do cumen t scores fromdi/#0Beren t collections can minimize the impact on retriev alp erformance /#5B/2 /#5D/. In this pap er/, w ea v oid the issue of resultmerging b y assuming that searc hing di/#0Beren t collections pro/-duces comparable do cumen t scores/. Distributed retriev al inthe con text of the W orld Wide W eb is kno wn as meta searc h/-ing/, but curren t meta searc h engines suc h as MetaCra wler/#5B/1/8 /#5D t ypically send a query to a /#0Cxed list of p opular searc hengines and do not p erform collection selection/.The most common tec hnique for collection selection is torepresen t a collection as a w ord histogram/, whic h is usuallya list of w ords that o ccur in the collection and the asso ciatedfrequencies/. The virtual do cumen t represen tation in /#5B/2/, /2/3/#5Dis an example/. The w ord histograms are indexed and theresulting data structure is called the collection selection in/-
dex /#5B/2/3 /#5D/. Collection selection consists of simply ranking thew ord histograms against a query in the same w a y as rankingordinary do cumen ts/. Most other tec hniques are v ery simi/-lar/. Suc h a tec hnique is a simple mo di/#0Ccation of do cumen tretriev al/. Do cumen ts and collections of do cumen ts are/, ho w/-ev er/, v ery di/#0Beren t and tec hniques that w ork w ell for oneproblem ma y not w ork w ell for the other/. A do cumen t usu/-ally deals with only one topic but a t ypical collection candeal with man y topics/. Matc hing the w ords in a query withdi/#0Beren t topics in a collection can cause failure in collectionselection/. Supp ose a collection con tains do cumen ts ab outfruits and computers/. Matc hing the query /#5CApple Com/-puter/" against the histogram of the collection will pro duce
a high similarit y ev en though none of the do cumen ts arerelev an t/. Heterogeneous collections therefore mak e the sim/-ple tec hnique of matc hing a query against w ord histogramsine/#0Bectiv e for collection selection/. In fact/, if all collectionsare su/#0Ecien tly heterogeneous/, matc hing a query consistingof a few common w ords with w ord histograms can ev en pro/-duce random collection selection b ecause statistically all his/-
tograms are almost iden tical with relation to the query /.X uand Callan sho w ed that ine/#0Bectiv e collection selection seri/-ously h urts the p erformance of distributed retriev al /#5B/2/3 /#5D/.P ast researc h has sho wn that distributed retriev al ismark edly less e/#0Bectiv e than cen tralized retriev al /#5B/2/3 /#5D/. Ourgoal is to impro v e distributed retriev al and mak ei ta s ef/-fectiv ea s cen tralized retriev al/. The new approac hw e willprop ose is inspired in part b y do cumen t clustering /#5B/2/1 /#5D andlanguage mo deling /#5B/1/9 /#5D/. The language mo deling approac ht oIR views retriev al as estimating the probabilit y that a lan/-guage mo del can generate a query /. Language mo dels w ere
254originally used in sp eec h recognition to capture statisticalregularities of language generation/. In IR/, w ord order isless imp ortan t and therefore a simple language mo del canb e a probabilit y distribution o v er the w ords in a v o cabularyset/. The probabilit yo f aw ord in a language mo del can b ein terpreted as the frequency with whic haw ord is used todescrib e a certain topic/.Do cumen t clustering has b een extensiv ely studied in IR/.The cluster h yp othesis/, according to v an Rijsb ergen/, is that/#5CClosely asso ciated do cumen ts tend to be relev an t to thesame requests/" /#5B/2/1 /#5D/. A conjecture in do cumen t clusteringis that searc hing a few g ood clusters for a query can bemore e/#0Bectiv e than a full ranking of all do cumen ts/. Thepurp ose of do cumen t clustering in our w ork is to group do c/-umen ts according to topics/. Eac h cluster is regarded as atopic/. Language mo deling is then used to mo del the statis/-tical regularities of w ord usage in a topic and represen t thetopic as a language mo del/. W e call suc h a language mo dela topic mo del to di/#0Beren tiate from language mo dels esti/-mated for single do cumen ts in P on te/'s w ork /#5B/1/9 /#5D/. In P on te/'sw ork/, smo othing w as used to reduce estimation error causedb y insu/#0Ecien t data/. In our approac h/, since all do cumen tsab out a topic can b e used for parameter estimation/, topic
mo dels can p oten tially b e more accurately estimated/. Thisenables us to determine with high accuracy whic h topics areappropriate to searc h for a query and whic h topics are notrelev an t/. By fo cusing on a few topics ric h in relev an t do cu/-men ts/, distributed retriev al can p oten tially b e more accuratethan cen tralized retriev al/.In our approac h/, the task of a distributed retriev al sys/-tem is /#0Crst to determine whic h topics are b est for a queryand then to direct the searc hing pro cess to those collectionscon taining the topics/. The problem of determining the b esttopics is the problem of determining whic h topic mo dels aremost lik ely to generate a query /, whic h is amenable to math/-ematical treatmen t/. Since collection selection is based onho ww ell a query matc hes a topic/, w e eliminate some errorswith the old tec hnique that result from matc hing the w ordsin a query with di/#0Beren t topics of a collection/. A disadv an/-tage with our approac h is that it requires clustering largesets of do cumen ts/. The computational cost/, ho w ev er/, canb e made acceptable ev en on large collections/. Our approac his similar to the tec hnique prop osed b yW eiss et al for or/-ganizing W eb resources /#5B/2/2 /#5D but with signi/#0Ccan t di/#0Berences/.W e pro vide a range of solutions for di/#0Beren t retriev al en vi/-ronmen ts/. Collection selection in our approac h h a saw ell/-de/#0Cned probabilistic in terpretation while it is more heuristicin theirs/. F urthermore/, their approac h lac ks thorough ev al/-uation using realistic data sets/.In the next section w e describ e the basic approac h inmore detail/. In section /3/, w e describ e four metho ds of orga/-nizing a distributed retriev al system/. One is the old metho dof distributed retriev al with heterogeneous collections/. Theother three are new metho ds prop osed in this pap er/. Ex/-p erimen tal results are presen ted in sections /5/, /6 and /7/. Thethree new metho ds are ev aluated on TREC/3/, TREC/4 andTREC/6/, using the old metho d and cen tralized retriev al asbaselines/. In section /9w e discuss related w ork/.

Justi/#0Ccation for the metriccan b e found in textb o oks on information theory /#5B/1/6 /#5D/./2/./2 T opic Selection can Imp rove Retrieval E/#0BectivenessLanguage mo deling can explain wh y distributed retriev alwith topic selection can b e more e/#0Bectiv e than cen tralizedretriev al/. W e can mo del the writing of a do cumen t ab out atopic as a random pro cess/. Ho w frequen tly a certain w ordis used in the pro cess dep ends on the topic b eing addressed/.
F or example/, if it is ab out co oking/, /#5Coil/" and /#5Cfry/" ma yh a v ea high frequency /. Due to randomness in the pro cess/, a rel/-ev an t do cumen tm a y use the query w ords less often than anon/-relev an t do cumen t/. As a result/, a non/-relev an t do cu/-men tm a yh a v e a higher rank than a non/-relev an t do cumen tif w e rank the do cumen ts individually /. Because a collectiont ypically has far more non/-relev an t do cumen ts than relev an tdo cumen ts for a query /, the problem can substan tially a/#0Bectretriev al accuracy /. F or an example/, supp ose a collection has/1/0/0 do cumen ts ab out topic T/1 and /1/0/0/0 do cumen ts ab outtopic T/2/, all do cumen ts are /1/0/0 w ords long/, and w e are in/-terested in T/1/. Without reading the do cumen ts/, w e canassume they are generated according to t w o topic mo delsM/1 and M/2/. W e assume that the frequencies of w ords a andb are /0/./0/5 and /0/./0/5 in M/1 and /0/./0/4 and /0/./0/3 in M/2/. Since w ekno w a and b are more frequen tly used in T/1/, our query willprobably b e f a/; b g /. If w e rank the do cumen ts individuallyusing simple cosine metric/, the exp ected precision is only/5/5/#25 /#28when /1/0 do cumen ts are retriev ed/#29 based on our sim/-ulations/. If w e rank eac h topic as a unit/, w e are less lik elyto mak e mistak es b ecause random factors are cancelled outin a large sample/. The probabilit y that T/1 is rank ed b eforeT/2 is almost /1/0/0/#25 using the cosine metric/.The ideal case that all relev an t do cumen ts b elong to onetopic and all non/-relev an t do cumen ts b elong to other top/-ics is v ery rare in realit y /. That is/, relev an t do cumen ts fora query ma y b e distributed o v er sev eral topics whic h con/-tain b oth relev an t and non/-relev an t do cumen ts/. Ev en so/,topic mo deling can b e still useful to impro v e retriev al p er/-formance/. By fo cusing on a few highly selectiv e topics whic hcon tain most relev an t do cumen ts for a query /,w e can elim/-inate from the top retriev ed set man yo f the non/-relev an t
255do cumen ts whic h could be rank ed highly b y a full searc hwithout remo ving man y relev an t do cumen ts/. That is thereason w e b eliev e distributed retriev al with accurate topicselection can b e more e/#0Bectiv e than cen tralized retriev al/./2/./3 K/-Means ClusteringIn this pap er/, topics are appro ximated b y do cumen t cluster/-ing/. W e run a clustering algorithm on a set of do cumen tsand treat eac h cluster as a topic/. The t w o pass K/-Meansalgorithm is c hosen for this purp ose /#5B/1/3 /#5D/.

F or eac h do cumen tw e /#0Cnd the closest clusterand reassign it to that cluster unless it is already there/.
