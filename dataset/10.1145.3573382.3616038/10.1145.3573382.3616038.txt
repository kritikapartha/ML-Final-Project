ABSTRACT
The current study seeks to understand women’s success in eSport
through an analysis of their living experience (5 to 10 per country)
within the eSport industry in the MENA (Middle East and North
Africa) region. If little is known about the female gaming commu-
nity in that region, the absence/lack of data in MENA where eSport
is unequally developed offers a rare opportunity to: Identify women
who are active/successful in eSports and explore from their differ-
ent paths what works and what doesn’t in term of female inclusion
in the industry.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the number of women playing video games has
continued to increase, reaching almost 44% in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) [ 1], with almost similar rates than the US (48%)
[2]. Despite the growing popularity of eSports, less than 5% are
pro-gamers [3].
In response to this, many studies focus on these low representa-
tiveness rates to formulate the different barriers that arise in the
path of women [ 4] Thus, risk aversion [ 5], harassment [ 6,7], gen-
dered representations [ 8,9]and identification as a gamer [ 10,11]
are often cited as the main reasons why women would avoid pro-
jecting themselves and give up a possible career. At the educational
level, a study [ 12] showed that very few women received eSport
scholarships in the US, while men would get 88.5% of it.
Despite all the aforementioned obstacles, some women still man-
age to climb to the top of the podium, whether as pro-gamers (e.g.,

ter” Chi). This also holds true in the MENA region, where these
women are likely to face socio-cultural, economic and logistical
barriers.
This PhD research therefore serves two distinct but related pur-
poses: First, to identify women who work in the industry, and
secondly, to understand and analyze the life course of each woman
to draw from it the experiences, skills and knowledge that have led
them to success. Who are they and how did they succeed?
2 BACKGROUND AND KEY RELATED WORK
2.1 Barriers to women’s inclusion in eSports?
For a very long time, video games have been considered as a boys-
only leisure activity [ 13], be it magazines [ 14], women represen-
tations in games, whose sole function is to serve as the “female
interest” or the woman in distress whom the hero must save [ 15,16],
games for men made by men, or as McKinnon-Crowley [ 17] put
it , in reference to Kimmel’s book, “Guyland”, “One feature of the
Guyland experience is the social self-selection to spend time in
guy-only spaces [ . . .]Guys are encouraged to prove their masculin-
ity through competitive endeavors”. Thus, women are considered
intruders, often associated with casual -also called pink- games.
Therefore, being a girl in a gaming community is associated with
less skills and performance [18].
At the same time, the eSports industry is at the intersection of
gaming and sport, even if the debate regarding its consideration as
a sport is still contested [ 19,20]. A comparison of two studies, first
on female coaches of a football team [ 21] and second on female
gamers [ 22] (see also [ 23]) suggests that, the masculine hegemony
present in both communities [ 24], will push women to have to
negotiate even more their position and adopt coping tactics -in
pretty similar ways- like staying away from Voice chats, changing
their ID/ way of speaking, dressing, and behaving to sound/look
less feminine to avoid misogynistic comments. eSport may confront
them to more discrimination and stereotypes due to their gender.
All this may suggest that, by not feeling included, women would be
less inclined to project themselves into a career in eSports. To give
more concrete examples, the work of Drury et al. [ 21] discovered
that women football referees ended up considering harassment
as part of the job, and constantly had to juggle between “being a
woman but not too much”.
2.2 The growing interest of the MENA region
for eSport
During the past 5 years, MENA’s interest in eSports increased con-
siderably due to its popularization and its promotion though various
government initiatives. The growing number of players on all plat-
forms, with the help of more eSport tournaments (eFifa, Afro-Arab
Esports League qualifiers) resulted in an increase in digital gaming

revenue from 1.52 billion US $ in 2017 to 4.06 billion US $ in 2023
[25], justifying the growth of the sector.
In order to promote eSport, we noticed more or less the same
initiatives, for example, in the website of the UAE Ministry of
Economy, Entertainment streaming and gaming is mentioned as
a promising sector. We also found similar organizations such as
the Royal Moroccan Federation of Electronic Games (FRMJE), the
Tunisian eSport Federation, the Algerian Federation of Electronic
Sport, Jordan eSport Committee. Each country was promoting their
pro-players and had at least a national women’s team (e.g., of Val-
orant). Following that growth, a whole ecosystem has been built
around those government organizations. It is difficult to say ex-
actly when eSport started in the MENA region, but we can say that
eSports developed differently than in other regions and became
formalized later, the matter seemed to care less about whether it is
a sport or not, but rather to adopt what appears to be a phenom-
enon and to gain significant economic and social benefits from it,
including the inclusion of young people and their opening up to
new employment opportunities.
2.3 Women and eSport in the MENA Region – a
preliminary observation
The number of female gamers in the MENA region continues to
grow (34% of the 18-24 gaming community in MENA are girls),
as the result of the multiple initiatives focused on girls gamers in
eSport (e.g. Miss Esport, an initiative in collaboration with Lenovo)
or Girls-only Communities (such as Ladies Arena).
While it is possible to identify women gamer thanks to those
initiatives, the main difficulty remains to identify who can be con-
sidered an eSport player and who cannot. While eSport is based on
video games, not all video games are esport materials [ 26] because
not all videogames can be played in an organized and competitive
configuration nor have considerable prize pools [27]
Considering this, our research will require a deeper understand-
ing of the different jobs of the industry while also taking into con-
sideration eSport’s ranges of professionalization, from beginners to
professional esports players [ 28]. For now, the most encountered
profiles are often players, streamers, broadcasters (or any other
profession related to the media and event organization).
Many gray areas remain, due to the lack of quantifiable infor-
mation. We point out as an example the lack of clarification when
it comes to eSport Players, in our case that would be the profes-
sional status of these women. One can imagine that they would be
self-employed (freelance). This detail is important since, according
to the Global Gender Gap Report 2023 [ 29], women’s labor force
participation was only 43.5% compared to 86.9% for men in Bahrain,
13.8% (W) in Jordan versus 60.7% (M) and 20.9% in Morocco (W)
versus 70.4% (M). But because some eSports jobs are related to IT
and STEM, considering that women represent only 29.2% of all
STEM workers in the world, it is possible for them to have lower
chances of reach such positions and thus have a “successful” career.
3 METHODOLOGY
Due to its exploratory nature, this study will be carried out as
semi-structured interviews with 5 to 10 women working in eSports
in several countries in the MENA region (Middle East and NorthAfrica). Because eSport is relatively structured in the region, we
wish to identify and recruit women through Online Databases (e.g.,
Esport Earnings), Women in Games Ambassadors in the region, and
eventually National Teams of each country. If the primary goal is to
draw the experience of local women, we anticipate the possibility
of meeting international profiles during our survey who, despite
not meeting our demographic requirements, will most certainly be
able to enhance our study. Each interview should last a minimum
of 30 minutes, with no time limit.
As formulated, our research pertains to: How do/can women
in the MENA region make it to the top in eSports . The goal is
to distinguish from their experiences the drivers and facilitators for
their integration and success. The notion of success being subjective,
we will leave it up to our participants to define it.
For now, our interview guide is structured as follows:
1stSection: Presentation of the participant and their background
(educational, cultural and professional)
2ndSection: Barriers and challenges encountered
3rdSection: Identifying women’s drivers and the effect of internal-
ized misogyny
4thSection: Keys of Success
4 EXPECTED RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Through our interview guide, we expect to discuss with our par-
ticipants the following themes that might have shaped women’s
experience and success in their eSport career such as Family – Cul-
ture & Religion – School & Education – Hobbies – Work experiences
– Life experiences – Online/ in-game experiences – Personality- Or-
ganization & Affiliation – Role Model – Traits and Competencies.
5 CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS
This research is part of gender studies in the field of eSport in the
MENA region. If for the moment no conclusion can be drawn, we
hope in the coming months to carry out these interviews in order
to be able to answer our research question. Going to meet/discover
this largely unknown population and documenting its success will,
we hope, allow decision-makers and researchers to take a greater
interest in it and participate in making the world of eSports more
inclusive for all.
It would be interesting to expand the research area in the future,
which would not only allow intra-regional comparisons but also
and perhaps encourage initiatives toward gender’s inclusion in
eSports.
