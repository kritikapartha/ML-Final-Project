Different Denominators, 
Different Results: Reanalyzing CS Degrees by Gender, Race, and EthnicityCONTRIBUTED ARTICLESARTICLES
By Valerie Barr, Mount Holyoke CollegeStandard analysis of computer science degree data focuses 
on the percentage of degrees earned by women and 
men respectively, or on the percentage of degrees earned by racial and ethnic minorities respectively. This analysis is inaccurate because the groups involved are not the same size and their sizes have changed over time. Longitudinal comparisons are relevant only if statistics are computed 
separately for each cohort, examining the percentage of 
each cohort’s degrees earned in CS. The numerator should be the number of degrees earned in CS by a cohort, while the denominator should be all degrees earned by that cohort, not all degrees earned within the field.
INTRODUCTION
Seemingly every article about women in computer science (CS) employs a type of gender analysis that reports the per -
centages of overall CS degrees that are earned by men and by women respectively. Similar analysis is reported for the per -
centage of overall CS degrees that are earned by students in each racial and ethnic demographic category. The 2015 report published by the American Association of University Women 
[3] is one example of this approach. Addressing the intersec -
tion of gender, race, and ethnicity, they report that “ Although 
black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native women together made up 18 percent of the population ages 20-24 in 1  All degree analysis presented in this paper is based solely on United States data on 
citizens as provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [7] via WebCASPAR, 
working with the NSF Population of Institutions and the Academic Discipline 
“Computer Science.” Race and ethnicity data are based on the IPEDS Completion 
Survey by Race. Overall population data are from the US Census Bureau [8]. The data 
are organized in two gender categories (men, women) and five Federally stipulated 
race and ethnicity categories: American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific 
Islander, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, White non-Hispanic.2013, they were awarded just 6 percent of computing…de-
grees conferred that year. ” Similarly, “Women in the United States earn approximately a fifth of all computing degrees. ” Virtually every discussion of women’s degrees in computing [e.g., 6] discusses the widening gender gap among CS majors, particularly the fall off from 1984, when women earned 37% of CS degrees, to the present when women earn 18-20% of 
those degrees. 
This analysis of degree data, based on the percentage of to-
tal CS degrees that is earned by a specific group, is inaccurate 
and cannot be used for longitudinal comparison. It would be accurate and relevant only if the underlying population demo-graphics were completely static and the groups were always of equal size, but that is not the case within the U.S. There have been significant changes in the overall size and composition of the undergraduate student population. The undergraduate pool has grown and women, who in 1966 received 42.6% of all bach-elor’s degrees, now receive 56% of bachelor’s degrees.

ethnicity cohorts have never been of equal size, and, as Table 1acm Inroads  • inroads.acm.org   41
ARTICLESCOHORT ANALYSIS
As described above, disciplinary analysis has been carried out 
against a shifting data set. There has been significant growth in the size of the undergraduate population in the U.S., as well as shifts in the composition of that population. Therefore, rele-vant, useful, comparable data come from examining the extent to which each subpopulation is pursuing computing. In other words, the percentage of all women’s degrees that are earned 
in computing is a more useful and comparable statistic than is 
the percentage of all CS degrees earned by women. This by-co-hort approach makes it possible to do a longitudinal analysis of a field’s attractiveness for a specific demographic. Similar -
ly, examination of the percentage of men’s degrees earned in CS gives a more accurate basis for comparing the two gender cohorts. When the focus is on the percentage of CS degrees earned by women, no information is provided about how at -
tractive the field is to men since they are simply viewed as mak -
ing up “the rest” of the degrees. Similarly, a by-cohort analysis of degrees earned in CS by students in each race and ethnicity cohort gives an accurate way to compare the attractiveness of the field across different student populations. The analysis pre-
sented here is quite narrow, focusing largely on the change in 
perspective about representation in CS brought about by a shift to the by-cohort analysis. There are, however, many factors that go into choices students make about major discipline, includ-ing a host of social, political, and economic issues. Computer scientists are not necessarily equipped to fully analyze factors such as, for example, the concept of “personnel economics” and its impact on working conditions and salaries that has been ex -
plored by Claudia Goldin [4]. 
GENDER
Figure 1 shows the usual analysis of women’s CS degrees as a percentage of all CS degrees. For context, note that women earned 17.7% of all CS degrees in 2015 (8,765 degrees out of 49,279 total), while in 1984 women earned 37.2% of all CS de-grees (12,066 degrees out of 32,435 total). Contrast the stan-dard analysis of Figure 1 to that shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Figure 2 shows the percentage of women’s degrees that are 
earned in CS, while Figure 3 shows this information for both 
women and men (percentage of each cohort’s degrees that are earned in CS). There was relatively slow growth in CS degrees prior to 1980 as it took time for interest to ramp up once CS became a college major and schools began to add it to their offerings. After 1980, other than the period 1984–1988, women have earned CS degrees at a rate that ranges between 0.65% to 2% of all women’s earned degrees. By 1983, however, men had crossed the 3% line and have stayed above that through the dip in the 1980s and through the dot-com boom and bust cy -
cle of the 2000s. Particularly striking in the comparison of the two gender cohorts is the period since 2000. Men earned 5.52% of their degrees in CS in 1986, returned to that level (5.84% in 
2001), stayed high through 2006, and were back to 5.3% in 2015. 
Women, by contrast, have not come anywhere close to their 1986 high of 2.97%. The increased interest encouraged by the shows for the recent period, have also changed in relative dis -
tribution across the population, most notably for the White and Hispanic cohorts (note that in all tables of race and ethnicity data the columns do not sum to 100% as data are omitted for “multiracial, not Hispanic” and “Resident, ethnicity unknown”). Therefore, longitudinal data can never be accurate and compa-rable if based on the standard “percentage of degrees earned in the field” analysis. 
This approach must be replaced with an analysis that is car -
ried out separately for each demographic cohort, looking at the percentage of cohort degrees that are earned in a specific discipline and using as a denominator all degrees earned by that cohort. For computer science, specifically, a by-cohort 
analysis of degree attainment counters longstanding views 
on the distribution of computer science degrees by gender and by race and ethnicity, showing more accurately the ac -
tual changes in degree attainment by different demographic groups. The by-cohort analysis indicates that underrepresen-tation of women in computing is more serious than indicat -
ed in the by-discipline view. Furthermore, blanket assertions about underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities, based on national aggregate data, hide what may be signifi-cant underrepresentation within specific regions, institutions, and departments. As will become clear below, representation must be reconsidered in more ways than just the focus on un-dergraduate CS degree attainment, with a goal of understand-
ing various manifestations of underrepresentation across the 
school to career pipeline.
For example, given the overall shift in gender demograph-
ics of the undergraduate pool, there would be a problem today even if women’s percentage of CS degrees had stayed steady at 37% (the 1984 high point). As women became a majority of the baccalaureate pool, if they attained CS degrees at a steady rate they would have earned a higher percentage of overall degrees in CS. Instead there has been a shift from the high of 37% of CS degrees in 1984 to 17.8% in 2015, but the standard analysis does not give any indication of the concomitant change in rate of CS degree attainment by women as a cohort. The degree to which the field is or is not attractive to women is masked by use of the by-discipline analysis because it does not account for the larger demographic changes. Similarly, longitudinal analysis by race 
and ethnicity of CS degrees earned within a field suffers the 
same mathematical issue because it does not account for the change in overall demographics of the U.S.

Different Denominators, Different Results: Reanalyzing CS Degrees by Gender, Race, and EthnicityARTICLESdot-com boom led to 1.94% of women’s degrees being earned in 
CS, followed by a steep drop off down to 0.65% in 2010. There are signs of recovery, with a small increase to 0.86% in 2015, but women are still very far from their previous maximum and are nowhere near earning degrees in CS at the same rate as do men.
To better understand the different perspective provided by 
cohort analysis, consider two scenarios. First, what percent -
age of women’s degrees would need to be earned in CS for women to, once again, attain their former maximum of 37% of all CS degrees? To answer this, assume no change in the num-ber of men’s degrees and no change in their level of interest in the field. In 2015, the last year for which there is Federal data, men earned 40,514 CS degrees. If those were to represent 63% of the total (rather than 82% of the total, which was the case in 2015), there would have to have been a total of 64,307 degrees, with 23,793 of those earned by women. Assuming a redistribution of women’s degrees, rather than an increase in women’s overall degrees, these degrees would be 2.34% of all degrees earned by women in 2015. This would represent a return to the degree attainment rates of the 1984-1987 high 
point for women, or a significant increase over the 0.86% of 
women’s degrees that were earned in CS in 2015. This is un-surprising considering that in 2015 the percentage of men’s degrees that were earned in CS (5.3%) is also very close to their 1987 rate of 5.37%. 
For the second scenario, consider the degree situation if 
women earned CS degrees at the same rate as men, relative to gender cohort. What would this mean for overall CS degrees? In 2015, 5.295% of men’s 765,132 undergraduate degrees were earned in CS. If the same percentage of women’s 1,015,237 de-grees were earned in the field, they would earn 53,757 CS de-grees. A total of 94,271 CS degrees would have been earned, rather than 49,279, with 57% earned by women, in line with 
their overall proportion of the undergraduate population. This 
would represent a 91% increase in the overall number of CS degrees earned in that year. Of course, this kind of growth could happen only with significant capacity increases at colleges and universities and a shift in the academic choices made by wom-en. There is considerable documentation of the capacity and staffing crises that are already being faced given the current increase in demand for courses in computer science [2,6], and concern about how those crises will impact diversity in CS [2]. Furthermore, the relatively modest changes in women’s CS de-gree attainment in the past suggest that we should not expect to see a dramatic sudden shift in women’s academic choices.
RACE AND ETHNICITY
Race and ethnicity in CS can also be reanalyzed based on co-hort. The standard view, seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5, shows that the distribution of CS degrees across race and ethnicity groups tracks closely to the overall distribution of college de-grees. (The data used for this analysis starts in 1995, reflecting a change in the way NCES (National Center for Educational Statistics [7]) categorizes race and ethnicity. Prior data does not 
correctly correlate with overall degree totals). 010203040

ARTICLESorigin of the notion of “underrepresented minorities in com-
puting” since there is a large gap between the percentage of CS degrees awarded to White students and the percentage of de-grees awarded to all other groups. Yet this is also a situation in which the cohorts themselves are of vastly different sizes which is why degree attainment should be examined separately for each cohort. This mechanism is particularly useful for identify -
ing situations in which a cohort is relatively over- or under-rep-resented in CS degrees.
Figure 7 shows CS degrees for each race and ethnicity co-
hort, computed as a percentage of total college degrees earned by that cohort, over the 1995-2015 time span. The 2015 data also appear in the final column of Table 2. In other words, as an example, this shows CS degrees earned by White students as a percentage of all degrees earned by White students, and similarly for each race and ethnicity group. This better contrasts each demographic group’s percentage of the overall CS degrees 
and the cohort’s CS degrees as a percentage of the cohort’s total 
college degrees. The data clearly indicate that in 2015 students from all race and ethnicity groups except Asians earned CS de-grees at roughly the same rate. Figure 7 also shows that the dot-com boom and bust in the early 2000s had a very significant impact on interest in CS on the part of Asian students, while the impact on White and Hispanic students was more modest. By 2015 all groups had returned to a degree attainment rate that exceeded the 1995 rate, except for Black students. While their Table 1 provides seven years of overall race and ethnicity de-
mographics of the US (single race only). Table 2 shows the 2015 data for each cohort with percentages of overall population, of college degrees, and of CS degrees (note that the college de-gree and CS degree data do not include those degrees earned by non-citizens). These data are also repeated in Figure 6, show -
ing graphically that for all cohorts other than Asians the per -
centage of both college degrees and CS degrees is less than the group’s percentage of the overall population. For Asians both the percentage of college degrees and the percentage of CS de-grees are greater than the percentage of the overall population. The standard by-discipline view also shows that CS degrees are earned at a rate largely consistent with overall college degree attainment, except in the case of Asians which earn CS degrees at a significantly higher rate. As is the case for gender cohorts, this standard within-discipline data analysis does not actually compare the extent to which cohorts of students choose CS as an area of major study.

Different Denominators, Different Results: Reanalyzing CS Degrees by Gender, Race, and EthnicityARTICLESdot-com bust. For example, in 1995 Black women earned 2.3% of 
their degrees in CS. This rose to 3.5% in 2003, and then fell con-tinually for the next 12 years, reaching 1% by 2015. In the same time span, CS degrees earned by Hispanic women rose from 1.1% in 1995 to 1.7% in 2003, and then dropped to 0.57% by 2010 and have been between 0.6% and 0.65% since. In general, for both men and women there is a visible difference in CS degree 
attainment across race and ethnicity cohorts prior to the dot-
com bust. This was followed by a period during which all race and ethnicity groups were much closer in terms of pursuit of CS degrees, and they have remained this way except for Asians who have started to recover (men starting in 2011, women in 2012). 
These data call into question the validity of blanket assertions 
about underrepresentation. While nationwide data indicate that, in aggregate, most race and ethnicity cohorts are earning CS de-grees at the same rate relative to cohort, this can mask the fact that there may be significant underrepresentation within specif-ic institutions and departments. It also suggests the importance of looking at representation in more ways than just to focus on undergraduate CS degree attainment. Two areas of concern are 
preparation for college study and what happens after college grad-
uation. While outside the scope of this paper, one possible avenue of analysis would be an examination of high school enrollments and outcomes in the largest school systems in the country. For ex -
ample, in New York City the race and ethnicity demographics and gender demographics at the specialized high schools in no way mirror the larger demographics of the city [1]. There is significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic students, and women make up 42% of the population in the specialized high schools while they are 60% of the high school population at large. These high school experiences can affect both the subsequent decision to attend college and the choice of major discipline in college.
Given that undergraduate CS degrees are being earned at 
roughly the same rate, relative to cohort size, for all but Asians, additional data examination is necessary to discern differences in the subsequent pathways to graduate study and industry positions. 2015 degree attainment rate is comparable to that of all other groups except Asians, it is lower than their 1995 rate. Note that the raw data for Native American students involves relatively small numbers compared to the values for other cohorts.
It is also interesting to examine CS degrees by gender within 
each race and ethnicity category. Specifically, for example, what 
percentage of degrees earned by Black women are in CS, what 
percentage of degrees earned by Asian men are in CS? These data are presented in Figure 8 for women and in Figure 9 for men. Note that the y-axis in Figure 9 is extended as degrees earned in CS by Asian men as a percentage of their total de-grees are notably higher, at 15%, than the comparable figure for Asian women or for Asian students overall.

ARTICLESof overall CS degrees, for comparison with the PhD enrollment 
and degree data. Note that this is a standard by-discipline analysis and the PhD data still do not mirror the undergraduate CS de-gree distribution. For example, 3.31% of enrolled PhD students in 2015 were Black, 2.64% of those awarded CS PhDs in 2015 were Black, while 8.6% of undergraduate CS degrees in that year were awarded to Black students. The data on PhD enrollment and PhDs 
awarded, especially when contrasted with the undergraduate de-
gree data, show that much work must be done to better balance these demographics. The Asian cohort is significantly overrep-resented, relative to its proportion of the overall population and proportion of undergraduate CS degrees, while Black and His -
panic cohorts are significantly underrepresented in terms of PhDs awarded. These issues should be addressed by both PhD-granting departments and by the undergraduate institutions that are pre-paring students to advance to graduate study.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The by-cohort analysis of degree attainment accounts for differ -
ence in cohort sizes, providing an opportunity for us to re-exam-ine longstanding views on the distribution of computer science degrees by gender and by race and ethnicity. The data on gender clearly confirm that women’s degree attainment in CS not only lags that of men but has been much more significantly impacted during each boom and bust cycle of CS enrollments. Figure 10 
shows a by-cohort analysis of men’s and women’s degrees across 
several STEM fields: biology, CS, engineering, math, physical sci-ences. Psychology is included for contrast. As a discipline it is If CS degree rates parallel the overall population demographics, does that trend carry over to industry and to graduate study? Sadly, the answer is “no” based on employment data from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 2016 report “Diversity in High Tech. ” [11] This report is based on 2014 data from the Em-ployer Information EEO-1 Report. This report may overestimate representation, when compared to single company reports from major Silicon Valley firms, because it considers an industry to be high tech if at least 25% of the total jobs within the industry are identified as “technology-oriented workers. ” [11] It also encom-passes a larger set of job categories than would likely be included 
if looking only at major companies in the computing field such as 
Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. The EEOC further di-vides high-tech employment into two sub-categories: Profession-als
2 and Technicians.3 Table 3 shows 2014 data for each race and 
ethnicity category, including percentage of the US population, of all college degrees, of all CS degrees, and the employment data. Employment across all private industries is relatively close to per -
centages of the overall population. Yet there is a dramatic shift in the data for high tech industries. For the Black and Hispanic co-horts, employment in the tech sector is significantly below overall 
population figures, below attainment of college degrees, and below 
attainment of CS degrees, while for Asians employment is signifi-cantly higher than both population and degree attainment. These gaps widen further for the Professionals category which includes software development and other CS-oriented jobs. 
Given that each cohort, except Asians, earns CS degrees at 
the same rate relative to cohort size, these disparities should not exist. One would expect from the degree data that employment 
in the tech sector, particularly in the Professionals sub-category, would mirror the distribution of CS degrees.
An analysis of data for PhD production [13], in Table 4, also 
shows disparities between cohorts. Note that columns do not sum to 100% as data are omitted for “multiracial, not Hispanic” 
and “Resident, ethnicity unknown. ” While “multiracial, not His -
panic” are included in the total degree and enrollment counts, 
“Resident, ethnicity unknown” and those students whose residen-cy is unknown are not included since their citizenship status is not known (and all other degree data reported here is for citizens). Undergraduate degree attainment data is included, as percentage 
2  EEOC includes in this category computer programmers, software developers, web 
developers, and database administrators.

Different Denominators, Different Results: Reanalyzing CS Degrees by Gender, Race, and EthnicityARTICLESand impact of these differences in degree attainment, and their 
economic and social implications. Women’s underrepresentation manifests as well in high tech industries where they hold 31.89% of jobs categorized as Professional and 23.74% of jobs categorized as Technician [11]. Data tend to be slightly worse at leading tech-nology companies which likely have a narrower range of positions from the Professional category. For example, Google’s 2017 glob-
al hiring for positions that would be considered Professional was 
24.5% women, bringing that part of their workforce to 21.4% wom-en [5]. While a focus on numbers of majors has some merit, the current situation suggests that we may need to look more close-ly at the pathways of students, many of them women, who study some amount of computer science but do not major in it. Given the ubiquity of computing across fields, the development of new interdisciplinary areas of study and research, and the distribution of women’s degrees across academic areas, perhaps it is time for a deliberate effort both in the academy and in industry to place high-er value on interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity [9]. 
The analysis of data by race and ethnicity provides the founda-
tion for a new narrative about CS degrees earned by different race 
and ethnicity cohorts. While most race and ethnicity cohorts, as 
of 2015, earn undergraduate CS degrees at the same rate as the percentage of total degrees earned by the cohort, there are signif-icant representation disparities in subsequent graduate study and categorized differently at various institutions, sometimes as a so-cial science, sometimes as a science, and has a gender breakdown that is completely opposite of the other STEM fields. While there is not room here to do a complete analysis of these and other dis -
ciplines, the data show that women earn math degrees at about the same rate as CS degrees (less than 1% of women’s degrees every year since 1996) but that men also earn math degrees at a 
very low rate. Women’s degrees in physical sciences have never 
exceeded 1% of all women’s degrees and, again, men’s degrees are earned at a comparably low rate. Women’s engineering degrees have been over 1% of women’s degrees steadily since 1979, over 2% during the period 1984-1988, and were 1.97% in 2015. Men’s engineering degrees, however, outstrip their degrees in all other STEM fields. Women’s biology degrees, which were already over 3% of women’s degrees in 1966 when the NSF data starts, have climbed steadily, reaching 8.24% of all women’s degrees in 2015, while men now earn biology degrees at a comparable rate (7.68% in 2015). To put additional perspective on this data, in 2015 wom-en’s humanities degrees comprised 10.63% of all women’s degrees (a steady decline since 1966) and men’s humanities degrees were 
9.48% of all men’s degrees. Women’s overall STEM degrees (not 
including Psychology) were 13.16% of women’s degrees while men’s overall STEM degrees were 27.4% of their degrees.

ARTICLESin the work force. Examining the data in this way indicates which 
student groups may need to be better prepared for the industry careers and graduate study that can follow their undergraduate CS degree, and the tech industry also must examine hiring prac -
tices. In addition, new research directions are suggested by the by-cohort analysis. As mentioned above, there must be a thor -
ough examination of the gender demographics and race and eth-
nicity demographics of college preparation in various high school 
programs. To the extent that data are available, there should be an examination of the intersection of race and ethnicity with so-cio-economic standing. One element of this could be a study of trends along race and ethnicity lines in attendance at two-year institutions and at the transfer rate of students from two-year institutions into 4-year CS programs. In general, as cohort sizes continue to shift within the U.S., longitudinal by-cohort analysis will enable both identification of changes in long term participa-tion in computing and improved understanding of factors that impact student success after graduation.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Virginia Valian, Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychology, 
Hunter College. Dr. Valian’s book Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women [12] led to the 
‘aha moment’ that prompted me to start thinking differently about degree data. A surprise 
message from Dr. Valian years later encouraged me to extend this work to non-STEM 
fields, a project in which I am still engaged. I also thank Becky Packard, Mount Holyoke 
College, and Revi Sterling, U.S. AID, as well as the anonymous reviewers, all of whom 
provided thoughtful feedback. Aaron Cass, Union College, provided key R help. Finally, I 
am also grateful to Eleanor Harris, Mount Holyoke College Class of 2020, who painstakingly 
updated and double checked all the data, wading unafraid into the vagaries of WebCASPAR.
