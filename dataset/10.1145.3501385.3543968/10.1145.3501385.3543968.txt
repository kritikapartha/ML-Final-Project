ABSTRACT
Background and Context: Inequities in computing education
have been identified based on gender, race, ethnicity, and economic
status. However, extant quantitative research tends to treat demo-
graphics as siloed categories instead of accounting for the fact that
many students are members of multiple minoritized groups. There
is also a conspicuous lack of research that examines equity issues at
multiple stages of the education pipeline. Objectives: Our research
questions asked: 1) How are gender, race/ethnicity, and economic
status related to the likelihood that students will enroll in com-
puting courses in high school? 2) How are these factors related
to the likelihood of enrollment in college computing courses? 3)
How do these factors relate to wage earnings for students who ma-
jored in computer science in college? Method: This study analyzed
education and workforce data in the United States using multi-
level logistic and linear regression analyses to identify disparities
among students from multiple minoritized groups at three stages
of life: high school (N=135,961), college (N=199,230), and career
(N=1,251). Findings: Compounding course enrollment disparities
were present at the high school level for students who are Black
or Hispanic/Latino/a and female, economically disadvantaged, or
both. Similar results were observed at the college level. Only gender
was a statistically significant predictor of wage earnings five years
after college graduation, but results of this analysis may be attenu-
ated by the fact that relatively few students who were members of
multiple minoritized groups graduated with a computing degree.
Implications: These findings demonstrate the importance of con-
sidering students’ intersecting identities when assessing equity in
computing education. They also lay groundwork for understanding
how early inequities persist across the education pipeline and how

1 INTRODUCTION
Gender disparities in computer science (CS) education have been a
persistent problem [ 30]. Female students have been consistently un-
derrepresented in secondary and postsecondary CS courses, and this
disparity has carried over into the computing workforce, where the
number of men significantly outweighs the number of women. Al-
though gender disparities have been more thoroughly documented,
other demographic groups have also been shown to be underrepre-
sented in CS education, including racially/ethnically minoritized
students and students from low-income backgrounds [ 8]. Despite
its importance for identifying and supporting minoritized student
populations, disparities at the intersection of these demographics
categories are rarely examined in research. Recent studies have
begun looking at a few of these intersections (e.g., gender and so-
cioeconomic status), but this is usually in a context specific to one
level of computing education (e.g., secondary CS courses; [ 15]), and
we know of no studies to date that have interrogated disparities at
these demographic intersections for a broader scope of the com-
puting education pipeline. In this study, we address this research
gap by using a statewide longitudinal data system in the United
States (U.S.) to examine differences in CS course enrollment at the
61ICER 2022 V1, August 7–11, 2022, Lugano and Virtual Event, Switzerland Warner, Baker, Haynes, Jacobson, Bibriescas, & Yang
secondary and postsecondary levels and differences in earnings for
graduates of postsecondary computing programs.
In discussing issues of educational equity, it is important to be
thoughtful about the terms and categories used to describe and
define different subpopulations and to be transparent about the
reasons for using those terms and categories. Thus, we offer a brief
preface of that nature here. Throughout this paper, we discuss
gender in a binary manner because that is how it is represented
in the data that were used both in the current study as well as
in the literature we review. We also discuss economic status as
a dichotomy largely because that is how it is often measured in
education data, where common practice is to categorize students as
being economically disadvantaged or not. Similarly, the categories
we use to reference race and ethnicity stem from the way race
and ethnicity are categorized in the data. In naming each of those
categories, we use the the same terms that are used in the data we
analyzed or, in instances where we cite previous work, the same
terms that were used in the articles we reference. When referring to
multiple groups that are underserved in education, we use the term
"minoritized." We do so to signify, as it has been done elsewhere [ 33],
that we conceptualize "minority status" as a socially constructed
experience rather than an indication of relative quantity.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 CS Enrollment in Secondary Education
Differences in enrollment rates in secondary CS courses and other
STEM subjects have been identified across multiple countries. In
terms of gender disparities, for example, male students were found
to be 2.5 times more likely than female students to enroll in ad-
vanced electives in CS and physics in Israel [ 15] and more than
eight times as likely to enroll in information technology courses
in Australia [ 18]. A study conducted in Canada noted that females
make up less than a quarter of students enrolled in high school
CS courses [ 12]. In U.S. high schools, only 20% to 30% of students
enrolled in CS are female [ 24,31,36]. In the United Kingdom (U.K.),
female students were found to take advanced CS exams at a lower
rate than males [14].
Secondary course enrollment rates also tend to differ by race/ethnicity
[9,14]. A report that provides enrollment data across 35 U.S. states
indicates that in three quarters of the states, high school students
who are White or Asian were more likely to take CS than students
who are Black or Hispanic/Latino/a [ 8]. In schools that offer Ad-
vanced Placement CS courses (which can confer college credit),
White and Asian students were two to three and a half times more
likely to take the AP exam than students from racially or ethnically
minoritized backgrounds [ 7]. Similarly, in British Columbia, First
Nations students enroll in technology and engineering programs
at lower rates than White students [35].
Disparities in secondary CS course-taking are also present in
terms of economic status. Although economically disadvantaged
youth make up 54% of high school students in the U.S., they com-
prise only 41% of students enrolled in high school CS courses [ 7]. A
study in the U.S. showed that students from lower-income families
were 11% less likely to take CS classes in general and almost 20%
less likely to take advanced CS classes than their higher-income
peers [ 34]. Results of studies conducted in Israel [ 15] and the U.K.[9] suggest that the relationship between economic status and CS
enrollment may vary by race/ethnicity, gender, or both.
2.2 CS Enrollment in Postsecondary Education
Disparities in CS enrollment are found at the postsecondary level as
well. Females comprised only 15% of CS majors in Ireland [ 11], less
than 20% in the UK, and 14% in Australia [ 32]. However, in some
countries, such as Malaysia, Taiwan, and Kenya, the proportion of
women who study CS was on par with men or higher [ 22]. As of
2018, only 19% of CS bachelor’s degree holders and less than 30%
of advanced CS degree holders in the U.S. were women despite the
fact a greater share of women than men held an undergraduate
degree or higher [ 16]. Some evidence suggests that the reason for
CS gender disparities varies by cultural factors within and between
countries [17, 22].
Less is known about the relationship between postsecondary
CS enrollment and either race/ethnicity or economic status. The
annual Taulbee Survey [ 37], which tracks enrollment trends in post-
secondary CS programs for a sample of North American institutions
of higher education, reports enrollment numbers by race and eth-
nicity (and gender). However, these numbers are not compared
against any overall racial/ethnic breakdown of students. Thus, it
is impossible to determine from the report alone whether and to
what extent there are enrollment disparities between students of
different races or ethnicities.
Research on enrollment in STEM courses generally has uncov-
ered disparities in terms of race/ethnicity and economic status,
which suggest that similar disparities may exist in CS education
specifically. For example, a study in the U.K. found that White
college students were more likely to enroll in STEM courses than
non-White college students [ 9]. A Canadian study of higher ed-
ucation showed that First Nations students in British Columbia
enrolled in technology and engineering programs at lower rates
than White students [ 35]. In terms of economic status, researchers
in the U.S. found that women of low socioeconomic status were
more likely than more affluent women to choose majors with high
earning potential (e.g., technical fields, health science), whereas
no difference was detected between men of low and high socioe-
conomic status [ 21]. Conversely, a study in the U.K. did not find
any relationship between income and choice of major for women,
though the authors did note a positive relationship between choos-
ing a STEM major and women’s socioeconomic position (a measure
based on factors such as parental education) [9].
2.3 Wage Earnings
It is useful to consider the extent that educational inequities carry
over or are reproduced in the workforce. One way to do this is
by examining differences in wage earnings. Gender differences in
earnings have been documented in multiple countries [ 1,2,19],
and these differences are often most pronounced in STEM fields.
In the U.S., women working in STEM fields earned approximately
74% of the median earnings of men in STEM in 2019, while the pay
gap in the labor market overall was 80% [ 16]. Similar differences
were found for computing occupations specifically, where women’s
median wages in the U.S. were 82% of that of men [ 26], a slightly
wider gap than the 84% average across European countries [29].
62Disparities in CS Course Enrollment and Wage Earnings ICER 2022 V1, August 7–11, 2022, Lugano and Virtual Event, Switzerland
Most of the available evidence regarding wage disparities in
computing occupations fails to account for other factors related to
earnings, such as education level. Some research on wage dispari-
ties in other occupations, however, has controlled for such factors.
For example, a study in Norway found that immigrants earned less
than native Norwegians in both nursing and engineering profes-
sions after controlling for age and years since graduation [ 19], and
a U.S. study discovered that Asian and Black chemists received sig-
nificantly less pay than White chemists with comparable education
levels [4].
Examining wage differences between groups in computing oc-
cupations addresses questions of workforce equality, but wage
disparities can also be a reflection of inequalities in education. One
way to measure this is to compare wages between groups holding
the same degrees regardless of their occupation. Such comparisons
make a clear connection to education, as they address the question
of whether the benefits of CS education differ for distinct groups of
students. In other words, whereas wage disparities between groups
in the computing profession may be an indication of workforce dis-
crimination, wage disparities between groups holding computing
degrees may be an indication of how CS education benefits some
groups more than others, whether due to differences in the types of
occupations students enter into, workforce discrimination, or some
other factor.
Although some survey data has shown that female CS graduates
tend to earn less than male CS graduates [ 28], we were unable to find
any research that makes such comparisons between groups based
on race/ethnicity or economic factors, nor did we find any studies
that looked at gender differences while controlling for other factors.
However, such studies have been conducted for STEM graduates in
general. For example, one study showed that wage disparities be-
tween men and women STEM graduates in the U.S. persisted even
after controlling for multiple factors such as GPA, age, parental
education, and marital status [ 20]. A study in Poland showed that
wage disparities between male and female STEM graduates were
relatively small one year after graduation but steadily grew over
time, peaking 11 to 16 years post-graduation at an average differ-
ence of about 28% [38]. In the U.S., Black graduates in STEM have
been shown to have significantly lower earnings than White STEM
graduates [20].
Some research has examined wage disparities at the intersection
of gender and race but, again, not for CS graduates specifically. For
example, among science and engineering doctorate recipients in
the U.S., researchers found that males tended to earn more than
females across all race/ethnicity groups and that females who were
Black, Hispanic/Latina, American Indian, or Alaska Native had the
lowest average salaries when compared to Asian males, Asian fe-
males, White males, and White females [ 5]. Similarly, an analysis of
large national datasets in the U.S. showed that for all race/ethnicity
groups working in STEM, women had lower wages than men, with
Asian men receiving the highest and Black and Hispanic women re-
ceiving the lowest earnings [ 16]. These findings in STEM education
underscore the need to address this research gap in CS education
by analyzing data through an intersectional lens and not simply
looking a demographic factors in isolation.3 CURRENT STUDY
Gender, racial/ethnic, and economic disparities have been found
across multiple countries and at all stages of the education pipeline,
but such research in CS education is still nascent and incomplete.
This study sought to better understand gender, race/ethnicity, and
economic disparities in CS by including all three demographic cat-
egories in three multilevel regression analyses designed to predict
secondary course enrollment, postsecondary course enrollment,
and wage earnings five years after postsecondary graduation for in-
dividuals who earned degrees in CS. As noted previously, inequities
in CS education have been identified for each of these demographic
factors separately, but little work as examined the intersection of
these factors. This is surprising given that the importance of inter-
sectionality for how we consider matters of gender and race has
been discussed for decades [ 10]. As many students are members
of multiple minoritized populations, it is important to estimate
and test the relationship between these factors and the outcomes
within the same models in order to understand whether and to
what extent disparities are compounded for students of multiple
minoritized groups. In other words, are the computing education
inequities faced by female students, students minoritized based
on race/ethnicity, and economically disadvantaged students exac-
erbated when students are members of more than one of these
groups? We investigated this issue within the context of three
broader research questions: 1) How are gender, race/ethnicity, and
economic status related to the likelihood that students will enroll in
secondary computing courses? 2) How are these factors related to
the likelihood of enrollment in postsecondary computing courses?
and 3) How does the gender, race/ethnicity, and economic status of
students who majored in CS relate to later wage earnings?
4 METHOD
4.1 Data Sources
Data were obtained through the Texas Education Research Center,
a longitudinal data system that contains course enrollment and
demographic data for all students enrolled in public schools in the
state of Texas in the U.S. [ 27]. It also contains basic employment
information for all individuals who were paid wages in the state.
Person-level data within the system are linked across time and
data source type (i.e., education and workforce data) by unique
identification numbers.
In secondary education in Texas, CS courses are taught primarily
at the high school level (grades 9-12, ages 14-18). We selected a
cohort of students who began high school in 2012, which allowed
us to track their enrollment in CS courses across four years of high
school (through 2016) and four years of college (through 2020). Less
than half of all high schools in the state offered CS courses between
2012 and 2016. Accordingly, for the analysis of secondary course
enrollment, we limited our sample to students who attended schools
that offered one or more CS courses (N=135,961) during these years.
For the analysis of postsecondary course enrollment, we included
all high school students who went on to attend college in the state,
regardless of whether they attended a high school that offered CS
courses (N=199,230). Using different methods of limiting these two
samples was purposeful. We wanted to investigate participation in
CS education distinct from access to CS education. At the secondary
63ICER 2022 V1, August 7–11, 2022, Lugano and Virtual Event, Switzerland Warner, Baker, Haynes, Jacobson, Bibriescas, & Yang
level, this meant limiting the sample to students who attended
a high school that offered CS courses. Because most high school
students are unable to choose which high school they attend (public
school attendance is primarily based on the location of the student’s
residence) and because a large number of high schools in the state
offered no CS courses, including all high school students in the
sample would have prevented us from being able to determine
whether disparities in enrollment rates were due to differences in
who enrolled in CS courses, differences in who had access to CS
courses, or both. By only including students who attended schools
that offered CS, we could ensure that any disparities in enrollment
truly represented disparities in participation and not disparities in
access or a conflation of the two. At the postsecondary level this
is not an issue given that students can, for the most part, choose
the colleges to which they apply and ultimately attend. And even
in cases where students are limited in their choice of college, the
fact that nearly all postsecondary institutions in the state (i.e., 95%
of the 2-year colleges and 97% of the 4-year universities) offered
CS courses makes it is unlikely that a student would end up in a
college that did not offer CS. Thus, it was not necessary to limit the
postsecondary sample in the same way the secondary sample was
limited. Lastly, for the analysis of wage earnings, we included as
our sample the cohort of students who graduated with a CS degree
in 2015 (N=1,251), as this was the latest cohort of CS graduates for
whom we had wage earnings data five years after graduation.
4.2 Measures
Three dependent variables were examined. First, secondary course
enrollment was a binary variable indicating whether students took
one or more CS courses in high school. High school courses quali-
fying as CS were identified in previous work [ 3]. Second, postsec-
ondary course enrollment was a binary variable indicating whether
students took one or more CS courses in college, including at the un-
dergraduate and graduate levels (sometimes referred to as graduate
and postgraduate levels, respectively). CS courses were identified
using the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes [ 13].
Finally, wage earnings was a continuous measure of individuals’
earned wages (including wage and salary income) during the first
quarter of 2020 and was standardized (using z-scores) for the anal-
ysis.
The primary independent variables of interest were gender,
race/ethnicity, and economic status. Gender was included in each
analysis as a binary variable indicating whether the student was
identified as female. For race/ethnicity, individuals in the data are
classified in one of seven mutually-exclusive categories: American
Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic
or Latino/a, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Two or more
races, or White. Extant data shows that, in the Texas school system,
Black students and Hispanic/Latino/a students have been consis-
tently underrepresented in computing courses, whereas Asian stu-
dents and White students have been consistently overrepresented
in computing courses [ 6]. Thus, the focus of our analyses was to
investigate the extent to which the outcomes for Hispanic/Latino/a
students and Black students differed from Asian students and White
students. Accordingly, Asian students and White students consti-
tuted the reference group in terms of race/ethnicity in each analysis,and three binary indicator variables representing whether students
were Black, Hispanic/Latino/a, or of another race/ethnicity were
included in the models. Combining certain racial groups into an
"another race/ethnicity" category also allowed us to include all
students from the sample in the analysis, as the small number of
students in some of these groups would have prevented their in-
clusion in the analysis due to statistical constraints or in reporting
due to data privacy laws.
For economic status, a binary indicator was included in each
model indicating whether the student was economically disadvan-
taged. For the secondary course enrollment analysis, economic
disadvantage was defined as qualifying for free or reduced-price
meals under the National School Lunch Program [ 25]. For the post-
secondary course enrollment and wage earnings analyses, students
were identified as economically disadvantaged if they received a
Federal Pell Grant, which are issued to students demonstrating
financial need. Additional variables were included in the wage earn-
ings analysis to control for the level of computing degree obtained
(i.e., bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral).
4.3 Analysis
Univariate and bivariate statistics for the relevant variables were
examined to identify any patterns of missing data and ensure that
the measures were appropriate for use in each of the three analyses.
No patterns of missing data were detected, and all independent
variables showed adequate univariate and bivariate distributions.
Tolerance statistics indicated that no severe multicollinearity was
present among any of the predictors. Inspection of residuals con-
firmed the absence of extreme outlying observations.

secondary students who did and did not take CS across 4 years of

postsecondary course enrollment, three-level logistic regression
was employed with students (Level 1 or L1) nested in schools (L2)
and schools nested in school districts (L3). For the analysis of wage
earnings, two-level linear regression was used with individuals
(L1) nested in the schools where they obtained their computing
degrees (L2). For each dependent variable, three types of models
were analyzed. Model 1 estimated only the main effects of each
independent variable. The presence of two or more statistically sig-
nificant main effects here would indicate that each significant effect
likely accounts for variation in the outcome that is not explained
by the other measures. Model 2 estimated the simple effects of the
race+gender categories and the main effects of the other variables.
Iterating these models with different race+gender subgroups as
the reference allowed us to estimate differences in the outcomes
between specific groups. Model 3 included the same variables as
Model 2 plus additional terms representing the interaction between
race and economic status. This allowed us to determine whether the
effect of economic status differed for different gender+race groups.
Comparing results across the three models (and to some extent
within Models 2 and 3) can help determine whether disparities for
students who were members of two or three minoritized groups
(i.e., in terms of race, gender, and/or economic status) were com-
pounded beyond that of students who were members of one or two
minoritized groups. The statistical significance of the fixed effects
was determined using a .05 alpha level. Results of each analysis
are reported in the section below, including tables containing a
summary of the regression results of each model. Tables containing
the full set of regression results for each model are provided in the
appendix.
5 RESULTS
5.1 Secondary Computing Courses
Results of Model 1 (main effects) showed that female students,
Black students, Hispanic/Latino/a students, and students who were
economically disadvantaged were less likely than their peers to
enroll in CS courses (Table 5). Results of Model 2 (simple effects)
showed all race+gender subgroups to be less likely than Asian males
and White males to enroll in CS courses, but differences in the
odds ratios suggested that the disparity for Asian females was less
severe than for the other female subgroups and that Black females
may have experienced the greatest disparity (Table 6). Additional
iterations of the analysis with different reference groups confirmed
this to be the case. Among males, the disparity was greatest for
Black students.
Results of Model 3, which includes terms representing the inter-
action between gender+race and economic status, indicated that,
compared to Asian and White males, the effect of economic sta-
tus was greater for all other race+gender subgroups except those
already facing the greatest disparities (i.e., Black females and His-
panic/Latina females), for whom the interaction terms were not
statistically significant (Table 6).
The odds ratios reported in the table indicate the difference in
likelihood of enrolling in CS for a given group compared to the
reference group. Values less than one signify a decrease in the odds,
whereas values greater than one indicate an increase in the odds.
Computing the inverse of an odds ratio can aid in interpretation.Table 5: Multilevel Logistic Regression Results Summary

For example, Table 6 shows that students without economic disad-
vantaged were 1.19 times more likely (in terms of the odds) to take
CS than students who were economically disadvantaged (1 ÷0.84
= 1.19), and the odds of enrolling in CS were 8.33 times greater for
Asian and White males than Black females (1 ÷0.12 = 8.33).

1Odds Ratio
The results of these three models suggest that the disparities
faced by students who are female, Black, Hispanic/Latino/a, or eco-
nomically disadvantaged are compounded for students who are
members of two or more of these subgroups. For example, Model
2 shows that the likelihood of taking CS compared to Asian and
66Disparities in CS Course Enrollment and Wage Earnings ICER 2022 V1, August 7–11, 2022, Lugano and Virtual Event, Switzerland
White males was lower for Black females (0.14) than it was for both
Black males (0.39) and non-Black females (0.20 to 0.76). Results
from Model 3 indicate that, with the exception of Black females
and Hispanic/Latina females (the two gender+race subgroups with
the lowest likelihood of taking CS compared to Asian and White
males), the likelihood of taking CS decreased even more for stu-
dents in these gender+race subgroups who were also economically
disadvantaged. This is evidenced by the fact that the terms rep-
resenting the interaction of gender+race and economic status for
these groups were statistically significant (p<.05) with odds ratios
below 1.0 while controlling for the main effects of gender+race and
economic status.
5.2 Postsecondary Computing Courses
Model 1 results showed that students who are female, Black, His-
panic/Latino/a, or economically disadvantaged were less likely than
their peers to enroll in postsecondary CS courses.

Model 2 results showed that all female subgroups and Black
males and Hispanic/Latino males were less likely than Asian and
White males to take CS courses in college. Additional iterations of
Model 2 utilizing different gender+race subgroups as the reference
group indicated that, similar to enrollment in secondary CS courses,
Asian females were more likely than other female subgroups to take
CS. In contrast to secondary enrollment, however, there were no
differences in likelihood among non-Asian female subgroups. Model
3 results showed that, compared to Asian and White males, the
effect of economic disadvantage was greater for Hispanic/Latino
males and lower for Asian, Black, and Hispanic/Latina females

1Odds Ratio
Like secondary CS enrollment, these results indicate compound-
ing disparities in postsecondary CS enrollment for students who are
members of multiple minoritized groups. Although both females
and Black students were less likely to enroll in CS than Asian and
White males, the odds ratio for Black females was lower than it was
for both females and Black students overall. The same was true for
Hispanic/Latina females. The results of Model 3 show some differ-
ing effects of economic disadvantage by subgroup. Hispanic/Latino
males were less likely to take CS than Asian and White males, and
the negative effect of economic disadvantage on the likelihood of
taking CS was greater for Hispanic/Latino males than it was for
Asian and White males. In contrast, although Asian females and
Hispanic/Latina females were less likely to take CS than Asian and
White males, this difference was somewhat attenuated for Asian and
Hispanic/Latina females who also faced economic disadvantage.
5.3 Wage Earnings
Model 1 results showed that, on average, female CS majors earned
about one quarter of a standard deviation (approximately $13,000
USD annually) less than their male counterparts five years after
graduation (Table 9). No differences in earnings were found between
individuals who were Black or Hispanic/Latino/a and individuals
who were Asian or White, nor between those who were econom-
ically disadvantaged in college and those who were not. In the
results for Model 2, only the earnings for the Asian female and
White female subgroups were statistically different (lower) than

Asian and White males (Table 10). We suspect that the lack of sta-

be due to the fact that they comprised only a small proportion of the
sample (less than 5% combined), which resulted in less statistical
power to detect differences. Because of the lack of statistical sig-

nificance for most of the simple effects of gender+race in Model 2,
and to avoid further loss of statistical power, we did not include the
simple effects of gender+race in Model 3. Instead, Model 3 includes
the main effects (as included in Model 1) plus interaction terms
between race/ethnicity and economic status. Thus, for comparison
purposes, we combined Models 1 and 3 in Table 11. Results of Model
3 indicated there were no interaction effects between race/ethnicity
and economic status.Table 11: Multilevel Linear Regression Results Summary

6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Much of these results align with previous research that has shown
gender, racial/ethnic, and economic disparities at different stages
of the computing education pipeline. Similar to what has been
reported at the secondary [ 7] and postsecondary [ 37] levels, fe-
male students were far less likely than male students to enroll in
CS courses. Black students and Hispanic/Latino/a students were
less likely to take CS courses in high school and in college, simi-
lar to other studies that found enrollment disparities for racially
and ethnically minoritized students at the secondary or postsec-
ondary levels [ 8,9,14,35]. Our results also indicated secondary and
postsecondary enrollment disparities between students with and
without economic disadvantage, similar to what has been noted
elsewhere [ 23,34]. In terms of wage earnings, little work has been
done to document disparities for CS graduates. Thus, the results
of this study make an important contribution to the field. More
work has been done that identifies disparities in earnings for STEM
graduates generally, however, and there are both similarities and
differences between the results of the analysis of wage earnings in
this study and the results of studies in the field of STEM education.
The wage disparity between men and women CS graduates was
similar to gender wage gap that has been reported in other STEM
fields [ 16,20,38]. However, contrary to other research that showed
disparities in wage earnings for racially/ethnically minoritized stu-
dents [ 4,19,20], we found no differences in earnings between Black
or Hispanic/Latino/a CS graduates and their Asian and White peers.
This study also contributes new insight to the field by analyzing
these demographic facts within the same models. This is important
to do because of how these factors are correlated. In the U.S., higher
proportions of Black and Hispanic/Latino students are economically
disadvantaged than Asian and White students. This correlation
then begs the question of whether disparities in CS enrollment
between students who are Black or Hispanic/Latino and students
who are Asian or White are really reflecting disparities between
68Disparities in CS Course Enrollment and Wage Earnings ICER 2022 V1, August 7–11, 2022, Lugano and Virtual Event, Switzerland
students who are and are not economically disadvantaged and,
conversely, whether differences identified in terms of economic
status are actually indicative of racial and ethnic inequalities. The
fact that both types of factors were statistically significant while
controlling for the other in this study shows that, at least for this
sample, racial/ethnic inequities exist alongside and in addition to
inequities in terms of economic status.
The results of this study also suggest that these disparities are
sometimes compounded for students who are members of multiple
minoritized groups. This finding has important implications for
how we measure and address inequities in computing education.
For example, it underscores the importance of accounting for the
intersection of students’ multiple identities when investigating
equity issues. When monitoring equity, for instance, in terms of
enrollment rates (whether for a school district, a university, or
an entire country), disaggregating counts of students by race and
gender (e.g., number of Black students, number of female students)
but not race+gender (e.g., number of Black female students) could
fail to identify disparities for those student populations that are the
most underrepresented in CS education.
An important limitation of this study is that the samples were
comprised of students from only one U.S. state. It is possible that
results would differ if the analyses were replicated in other U.S.
states and in other countries. However, the fact that one state pop-
ulation was used for all three analyses provides some benefit to the
study as well as it allows for comparisons among the analyses in
this study to be made more easily. Another limitation, specific to
the postsecondary analysis, was that only students who attended
college in state were included. This was unavoidable as course en-
rollment data were not available for students who attended college
out of state. However, it is important to note this limitation as it
may bias the results if there are patterns in terms of the types of
students who tended to attend college out of state versus in state.
By examining disparities in secondary and postsecondary course
enrollment and in wage earnings after postsecondary education,
this study has shown how inequities persist along the computing
education pipeline. In beginning this work, we had hoped to inves-
tigate differences in the likelihood of employment in computing
professions for CS graduates, as this would have allowed us to con-
tinue the trend of considering equity in participation in computing
that we assessed with the analyses of secondary and postsecondary
enrollment. However, the necessary data was not available to us,
and so we concluded this investigation of disparities along the ed-
ucation pipeline with an analysis of differences in wage earnings.
Future research that connects all three stages in terms of access
to and participation in computing would serve as a meaningful
extension of this work.
