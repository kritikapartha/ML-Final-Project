ABSTRACT
Enterprise search is very diﬀerent from Web search (for ex-
ample in the link structure or in the user’s needs and goal)
and some steps have been already done to exploit these dif-
ferences in order to improve the eﬀectiveness of enterprisesearch. In this paper we present the state of the art of the en-
terprise search ﬁeld with some open issues. We also present
a research plan that aims at using Information Retrieval,Semantic Web, and User Modelling techniques to cope with
these issues improving the current state of enterprise search.

1. MOTIVATION FOR THE PROPOSED
RESEARCH
Searching within an enterprise, and ﬁnding what you need,
is not an easy task as it is on the Web. However, the ex-pectations of corporate workers are rising due to the eﬀec-
tiveness of their satisfactory Web search experience. The
Enterprise Search (ES) systems should make accessible thecollective intelligence, translating it into a huge competitive
advantage for the enterprise increasing innovation, produc-
tivity and agility. Tools for ES are becoming more and moreimportant due to the necessity of handling large amount of
data in the context of the enterprise. Due to the speciﬁcity of
the data itself, as well as to the particular search tasks, new

acteristics that do not allow to reuse the same techniques
used in Web search as they are.
In this paper we sketch some necessary contributions to
the ﬁeld. We propose to leverage semantic technologies for
ES as already done for the Web and for the personal desk-
top. We exploit the diﬀerent types of items an enterprisehas to manage (e.g. people and documents). We employ Se-mantic Web techniques to integrate together structured and
unstructured data. We integrate Semantic Web and Infor-
mation Retrieval techniques in order to increase the searcheﬀectiveness in the enterprise. We propose methods to en-
rich and extract the semantic information within the enter-
prise. We analyse the diﬀerences between Web, enterpriseand desktop. We propose methods for systematic ES evalu-
ation. We propose methods for personalising the search user
experience.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A good deﬁnition of what ES includes has been provided
by Hawking in [29]:
search of the organisation’s external website;
search of the organisation’s internal website (its in-
tranet);
search of other electronic text held by the organisation
in the form of email, database records, documents on
ﬁleshares and the like.
This deﬁnition shows that there are diﬀerent aspects to take
into account such as intranet search; search in a P2P net-
work, given that each employee shares some ﬁle on her desk-
top; search in both structured (databases) and unstructured(documents) data; search for not only ﬁles (people search).
Some work has been already done in the ﬁeld of ES but
several open issues are still asking to be solved. The sub
problem of intranet search has been analysed in [25] wherethey show the diﬀerences between ES and Web search and
how to improve the performances of intranet search, and
in [58] where they propose methods for improving the ef-fectiveness of ES on navigational queries using dictionaries
and geographically tagging intranet pages. A list of the most
common ES users’ needs is presented in [37] and it is com-pared with the one for the Web proposed by Broder [9].
Security issues in ES have been handled by Bailey et al.
in [4] where they propose methods for secure search in thepresence of document level security within the enterprise.
25It is also known that the link structures of the Web and
the one of an enterprise are very diﬀerent. In an enterprisethe intranet structure is mainly hierarchical, where the por-tal is the root, which is not true in the Web where there are
diﬀerent entry points. In the enterprise intranet there are
also very few links between pages and, thus, a link basedalgorithm such PageRank or HITS would not work in the
context of ES. In [56] the authors propose a method to con-
struct implicit links between the pages mining access pat-terns. They then apply a modiﬁed PageRank algorithm to
improve the rank of the search results.
Also Semantic Web technologies have been applied to the
context of enterprise [26] but only in order to improve the
knowledge management using ontologies and not in partic-
ular to improve the search eﬀectiveness.
Open issues and problems in the ES ﬁeld have been de-
scribed in [29, 10, 47] and we sketch, in the rest of the paper,
a research plan to cover some of these.
3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
After describing the ﬁeld of ES we now list some open
questions that we take into account.
How can we query for diﬀerent item types together:
integrating document and people search
How can we query structured and unstructured data
together?
How can we beneﬁt from both Semantic Web and In-
formation Retrieval techniques in enterprise search?
How can we enrich automatically the metadata anno-
tation in a social infrastructure?
Web, enterprise and desktop: how do they diﬀer?
How can we systematically evaluate enterprise search
systems?
How can we personalize the enterprise search user ex-
perience?
We describe more in detail in the next Section how we
intend to proceed in order to answer each of these researchquestions.
4. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AND PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS
In this section we describe for each of the listed open is-
sues, similar approaches and novel ideas on how to face the
problem.
4.1 Querying for different item types
together: integrating document andpeople search
Expert search is emerging as a primary task in enterprise
search. We can deﬁne expert search as the task of ﬁnding aperson (employee, associate, or anyone else in the enterprise)
who has a particular knowledge on a given topic. Being able
to search for people that are experts about a given topicallows to easily build a working team or to ﬁnd a person
who can solve a certain problem. Anyway, for example in the
scenario where the user is asked to write an overview page ofa certain topic
1, a list of both experts and documents would
1This scenario is used in the TRECent 2007 initiative.be helpful. Moreover, for some topics, the knowledge might
be better expressed in a document more than by an expert.For this reason we propose to merge people and documentsearch.
The topic of expert search is a relatively new one but al-
ready several systems have been proposed. The systems pro-posed in the past use several information and features like
Social Network information [39]; co-occurrences of terms and
changes in the competencies of the people; rule-based mod-els and FOAF
2data; and using posts on Web Forums [57].
One of the ﬁrst approaches is the Enterprise PeopleFinder
[44] also known as P@noptic Expert [19]. This system ﬁrstbuilds a candidate proﬁle attaching all documents related to
her/him, giving diﬀerent weights to the documents based on
their type (e.g., a homepage is more important than otherWeb pages), in one big document which represents the can-didate. Some steps in the direction of deﬁning formal models
for expert search have been made and models based on prob-
ability and language models [3, 5, 6] have been proposed andare widely used [54]. Another work which proposes a model
for expert search [43] considers this task as a voting problem.
In this model the documents associated with the candidateare viewed as votes for the candidate expertise.
A common idea in the community of expert search is that
two diﬀerent approaches are possible: expert ﬁnding andex-
pert proﬁling [7]. The former approach aims at retrieving
ﬁrst the documents relevant to the query and extracting the
experts from them. The latter ﬁrst builds a proﬁle for eachcandidate and then matches the query with the proﬁles with-out considering the documents anymore [8]. Our model tries
to merge these two approaches because it builds a weighted
proﬁle for each candidates and keeps in the model all thedocuments without losing information, allowing to retrieve
both people and documents together.
We propose to consider the experts as well as the docu-
ments as vectors in a vector space [21] placing people in the
same space as the documents. Our extension of the vector
space model assumes to have a weighted relationship be-tween a candidate expert and all the documents related to
her/him which indicates the degree of aboutness of the doc-
ument with respect to the candidate allowing a simple inte-gration of the already proposed techniques in the ﬁeld of IRand it also allows to take into account several other evidences
of expertise. In this way it is possible to retrieve candidates
in the same way as it is possible to retrieve documents justcomputing the vector corresponding to the query and rank-
ing the results using a similarity measure. Several ways of
extracting topics of expertises can also be considered. Someexamples can be to consider as topics the terms, or lexical
compounds, or also using document clustering to ﬁnd the
main topics of a given collection. These topics will thenform the basis of the vector space in where we place both
documents and candidates. Entity extraction techniques to
identify the candidate occurrences also help to improve theeﬀectiveness of such expert search system.
4.1.1 How many experts to retrieve?
The underlying motivation for expert search is that the
user is trying to solve a problem and needs help, or that theuser is building a new working group and needs particular
expertises.
2http://www.foaf-project.org/
26One problem of expert search is how many experts the
system should retrieve. We can imagine that a general topicshould have a bigger number of expert than a very spe-ciﬁc topic on which only few people are really experts. In
the context of expert search the system should be able to
understand the speciﬁcity of the topic and retrieve a rea-sonable number of experts and not a ﬁxed number for each
topic. The state of the art expert search systems do not con-
sider this as an issue returning to the user a ﬁxed numberof ranked experts.
We propose to automatically detect the query speciﬁcity
and to adapt the results according. We evaluate and com-pare the goodness of the method with proper metrics.
4.2 Querying structured and unstructured
data together
The knowledge management in an enterprise has to face
the problem of having both structured and unstructureddata. For example there are both the database containing
the vital statistics of the customers (that are structured)
and reports or product description documents (that are un-structured). An ES system should be able to allow the user
to search in both the types of data at the same time, with
the same query [49].
There is then the need to query structured and unstruc-
tured data together. Some recent work on how to perform
unstructured queries on structured data have been done [42,40, 51]. Also works on answering structured queries on un-
structured data have already been presented [41]. Then,
the next step would be the integration of these techniquesin order to provide the user with a transparent search in-terface over all the heterogeneous collections of data within
the enterprise (intranet pages, wiki pages, databases, public
W eb pages, ...) using meta-searc h and rank aggregation
techniques [45, 24]. The need of incorporating these two
types of queries has been described also in the context of
object level search on the Web [48] which also reﬂects wellthe requirements in the Enterprise scenario.
An open issue is how to query structured and unstructured
data together. Hawking [29] proposes to translate structuredand unstructured document in a common format (XML) in
order to search for both together. We think it is possible
to keep the native formats adapting the query diﬀerently asdescribed above (see for example [34] for transformation ofkeyword queries in structured ones). We can then merge the
results (rankings) of the diﬀerent queries using techniques
such the one proposed by Fagin et al.
3in [25]. Our idea
is to base it on a Service Oriented Architecture that allows
each datastore to provide a search service customized on
the particular data type. Diﬀerent systems in the enterprisecan then provide standard services that can be accessed by
other heterogeneous systems. A central ES system would
then integrate the results of diﬀerent search services [20]and present them to the user (see Figure 1).
Another still open issue is how to present to the user re-
sults from searches on structured and unstructured data to-gether. In searching unstructured data the user is usuallypresented with an ordered list of items (i.e. documents)
and in searching structured data the user is usually pre-
sented with a set of items (i.e. database tables). An ESsystem should present the results of such global search in a
3They aggregate ranks of unstructured data only.

prise search system
way where the items are ranked together and homogeneously
presented.
4.3 Bringing together Semantic Web and
Information Retrieval techniques
A lot of progress have been made in both the ﬁelds of Se-
mantic Web (SW) and Information Retrieval (IR) but there
have been not much eﬀort in integrating and reusing thetechniques developed in one ﬁeld to improve the results in
the other one. For example, the Beagle
++system4exploits
some SW techniques, such as metadata extraction, to im-prove the indexing of the documents in order to allow a
more structured and “semantic” search to the desktop user
through the metadata and the content together.
4.3.1 Combining SW and IR for expert search
In the ﬁeld of expert search disjoint works have been done
in both the IR and SW ﬁelds. Few eﬀort has been put in the
integration of the techniques developed in these two ﬁelds.
In particular, the IR research have been mainly working
in developing formal models for indexing of content to im-
prove expert search. These are based on language models,probabilistic models, vector space models, and others (see
Section 4.1). In the SW ﬁeld the eﬀort has been put mainly
on preparing data structures (extending standard ontologysuch as FOAF) for the expert search task. Expert proﬁleshave been deﬁned in various SW initiatives using common
ontologies (e.g. FOAF, SIOC) [1, 38, 31], and using Graphs
[52], but in the context of IR the most used way is a featurevector (with diﬀerent ways to compute the weights in it).
Our goal here is to integrate the eﬀorts done in both ﬁelds.
One open issue is how to properly index structured data suchas FOAF ﬁles in order to enable an eﬀective expert search
on such data structures. Some techniques from the XML
retrieval ﬁeld can be applied to this task. For example, inINEX 2007 there is an Entity Ranking track where the aim is
4http://beagle.kbs.uni-hannover.de/
27to return entities instead of just structured XML documents
or their elements.
4.3.2 Automatic tagging in enterprise
In order to provide metadata enabled search there is the
need to create metadata annotations together with enter-
prise documents and data.
As described by Delgado in [20] we can envision “doc-
ument services” that, given a document, extracts metadata
from it. The Beagle++system [12] adopts a similar approach
using metadata ﬁlters to create semantic annotations. It isthen needed to provide several such services which operate
at the data level (see Figure 1) that are highly customized
on the speciﬁc data formats (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Excel, ...)and types (e.g. publications, guidelines, receipts, ...). In
[23] the authors describe a system which allows the users to
implicitly (i.e. automatically) or explicitly (i.e. manually)tag intranet pages. The company Aduna
5also provides tools
for a semantic enterprise search mainly adopting information
visualization techniques to improve the search experience.
In the context of ES we propose an approach similar to
those for the desktop but also exploiting the social infor-
mation existing within an enterprise community (see Sec-tion 4.3.3). The content of desktops in an enterprise can beannotated using document services (available to each em-
ployee) developed for single document and data formats.
More, in an enterprise it is possible to exploit the infor-mation present in other repositories such as other desktops
or servers in order to enhance the metadata information
present on the user’s desktop which will enable an improvedenterprise search.
4.3.3 Metadata recommendation in a social
infrastructure
As already noted, people are the most important knowl-
edge resource of an enterprise rather than its documents. It
is also natural to see the enterprise as a community of peo-
ple. Inside a community of people that is using and creatingknowledge a concrete mechanism for data and metadata ex-
change between users must be present in order to enable
interaction and search for relevant material.
In the past there has been no investigation on possible al-
gorithms for recommending metadata in a social infrastruc-
ture. However, some relevant works can be found in otherareas, such as that of meta-search engines [45] and rank ag-
gregation [24] from where techniques can be adapted in order
to merge results from several other desktops. General rank-ing in social networks has been also already investigated in[27]. Many algorithms have also been developed in the ﬁeld
of databases for data cleaning and integration; they mainly
use text similarity functions and other techniques in order toimprove matching eﬃciency (as there is the need to process
big amount of data), rather than focusing on its quality (see
for example [2, 28, 13]). Similarly, the information about thelinkage between documents and the resulted graph structure
has been employed to match data from diﬀerent sources [32,
33].
One open issue is how to provide tools for metadata rec-
ommendation in a social infrastructure. For this reason we
envision a community of peers linked with each other in anetwork. The peers can decide which data and metadatathey want to share within the network and only those are
5http://www.aduna-software.com/used by the recommendation algorithms6.W et h u sp r o p o s e
methods suggesting and explaining why a certain document,a person, or an institution should be considered, linked to,or consulted in the given situation, or more generally, why
should some additional metadata from other members of the
community be considered upon annotating a local resource.
4.4 Web, enterprise and desktop: how do they
differ?
It is clear from the previous work that the structure of
the Web does diﬀer from the structure of an enterprise in-
tranet. Another observation is that in ES a common aspectis the heterogeneity of the document types (formats) such
as PDF, Word, slides, spreadsheets, .... This is a common
characteristic with the desktop search scenario, thus, tech-niques used in desktop search can be applied to ES. Anothercommonality between desktop search and ES is the need to
combine the structured and unstructured data allowing se-
mantic search. One example of how this is solved in thedesktop context is the Beagle
++system [12] which indexes
full text content together with structured metadata of docu-
ments using in a combined fashion a full text index (Lucene)and an RDF repository (Sesame); it is part of the Nepomuk
7
project which aims at building the Social Semantic Desktop.
On the counterpart, the desktop is related to a single user
but the enterprise is based on a community of people. That
is, the enterprise, as well as the Web, has to take into ac-
count the social aspect. The“social search”[11] is a trend in
the Web social environment and similar techniques can beadapted to the enterprise scenario. Another aspect is search-
ing in several environments. There are already commercial
product (for example Google Desktop) which presents theresults of the user query in both the Web and the desktop.
We propose the integration of search techniques developed
for diﬀerent types of collection. It will be useful for the en-terprise user to have the possibility to search at the same
time in the Web, the enterprise, and the desktop. High-
lighting the diﬀerences and the commonalities of these threeenvironments, with a deep analysis of their characteristics,
will allow an easier reuse or adaptation of known techniques
from one ﬁeld (e.g. Web search) to another (e.g. enterprisesearch).
4.5 Enterprise Search Evaluation
Enterprise managers face the problem of selecting one ES
system which best solves their particular needs and a com-
parison of available systems is usually done by third par-ties. A standardized and reproducible evaluation process is
needed in order to provide the managers with a fair compari-
son of ES systems helping them to take decisions. Moreover,our goal is to improve the ES systems eﬀectiveness. In order
to do this we need a proper way to evaluate the ES system
eﬀectiveness.
A proposal to evaluate the ES systems has been done in
[53] but it does not address a standard testbed for evalua-
tion. Instead, it mainly proposes a list of questions to con-sider when selecting one ES system and it does not reallyevaluate its eﬀectiveness. In [50] they consider the choice
of queries to be included in an hypothetical testbed for ES
6This scenario include the search in the ﬁleshares of the
employees: a sub-problem of ES as deﬁned by Hawking (seeSection 2)
7http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/
28evaluation. A TREC track for ES started in 2005 (TRE-
Cent) with the aim of providing standard testbeds. Themain problem, caused by obvious privacy issues, is that thetest collections are based merely on public Web crawls thus
not reﬂecting the whole available enterprise knowledge.
Several measures to evaluate IR systems have been pro-
posed [22] but they mainly target to evaluate Web IR sys-
tems. In the context of ES, diﬀerent from the Web where
there are best answers, there are only correct answers. Ifthere is only one correct answer for a query (as in the Ques-
tion Answering problem) probably the best measure is Suc-
cess@N which has also been already used for ES evaluationin [29] and [25].
In the particular task of expert search in TRECent, other
measures have been used with the assumption that not onlyone expert on the topic is needed by the user. In TRECent2006 the main measure used was mean average precision
over experts. The organizers also reported bpref, a metrics
which is computed only on the explicitly assessed items, tocontrol for incomplete judgements; and precision at 5 people
retrieved. The reason for these measures was that this is a
classical ad hoc task but we argue that probably the number
of retrieved items does matter (see Section 4.1.1) and this is
not taken into account by measures such as average precision
where the quality of the entire ranking (of 1000 candidates)is evaluated.
The concept of relevance have been evolving during the
time [46]. We argue that the evaluation of a ES systemneeds quite diﬀerent concepts for relevance deﬁnition and,thus, also diﬀerent measures given also that ES have been
shown to be quite diﬀerent from the standard Web search.
Basically, in classical IR, given a document and a query wecan deﬁne the relevance as a number relating the document
and the query.
The privacy is the biggest issue in building a ES testbed.
The problem is the same as in building a desktop search
testbed [14] thus we propose to adapt solutions developed for
desktop search to ES in order to improve the quality of EStestbeds. For the problem of which evaluation measure best
ﬁt the peculiarities of ES, we propose a comparison based on
the available test collections. In [37] the authors show that
“for high frequency queries, navigational needs are dominat-
ing” (mainly home page search). That is, the user is looking
for a particular page in the intranet inserting a query and
browsing, starting from the results, to the relevant page. Forthe particular task deﬁnition in ES, we propose to consider
in the deﬁnition of an evaluation measure also the distance
(possibly measured in clicks) between the retrieved resultsand the relevant one in order to measure the error commit-
ted by the system. For the issue of relevance deﬁnition in
an enterprise, we propose to include the context inside its
deﬁnition. For example the query “head of the department”
would have several diﬀerent meanings given the context of
the user. In this case the context would mean not only thegeographical location of the user, but also her“role”in orderto present diﬀerently the search results (see Section 4.6.2).
4.6 Personalization and user modelling
The context where the user is has started to be taken
into account to improve the ES eﬀectiveness in [30] where
they try to use information about the user’s task, history,
and device to reﬁne query and results. In Web Search thebrowsing context (i.e. the content of the Web page viewedat query time) has been used to deﬁne search algorithms
[36, 35]. The open question is still how to build or extractthis context from the user’s activities [55]. One step in thisdirection has been made creating a logger
8of user’s activities
in the context of search personalization. It is easy to see how
personalization techniques can be applied to the context ofES given that diﬀerent ﬁnal users approach the ES system
with diﬀerent informational needs.
4.6.1 Task based retrieval
In ES the queries are work related. This feature of the
queries should make the search easier and the system musttake advantage from it in order to improve its eﬀectiveness.
Given an eﬃcient method for identifying the present work-
ing context [15] we propose to perform a task based retrievalwhich will return personalized relevant results based on the
present user activity. For example a user currently working
on a project and querying for “requirements document” willﬁnd relevant only the document describing the requirementsof the project she is working on.
We also propose another optimization that the system can
do in order to identify the user’s task: to automatically iden-tify (also using learning methods) the query type and use
this information in order to adapt the search results. The
possible type of enterprise users’ needs have been presentedin [37] and a Lexical Analysis of Web queries have been pre-
sented in [18].
4.6.2 Customized search based on user role
Another advantage of an ES system compared to the Web
search systems is that it can beneﬁt of information aboutthe users which is more complete and easily available in theenterprise context compared to the web one. In an enter-
prise each employee has a role and a normal search system
does not use this additional information. Diﬀerent roles havediﬀerent information needs and a ES system should exploit
this information. Diﬀerent roles (like manager, IT, software
developers) with the same query have diﬀerent informationneeds.
We propose to measure the advantage brought by the
knowledge of the user role within the enterprise to a systemthat beneﬁts of this information to present results more rel-
evant to the user’s information need. For example the query
“password” may return a page for a standard user to reset
her password to a business manager or the protected Webserver administration page to an IT administrator. More
in details, after a ﬁrst not personalized step of the retrieval
focused on having high recall, a step of ranking the resultsbased on the user and focusing on high precision will be
done. Of course, also the knowledge about the workﬂows of
the users within the enterprise will be exploited.
4.6.3 Experience extraction from desktop content
and activity logs
Expert proﬁles of enterprise employee are needed to per-
form eﬀective expert search. As much information as pos-
sible should be integrated in these proﬁle in order to makethem as much detailed as possible.
Some papers that uses the desktop content to improve
and personalize the Web search results have already beenpublished (see for example [17, 16]). We propose to usesimilar techniques to extract key expertises of the desktop’s
8http://pas.kbs.uni-hannover.de
29user using its content and using activity logs in order to
build an expert proﬁle (see Section 4.1) which can be thenretrieved by an ES system. The proﬁle will be made of themain (that is, the most frequent and speciﬁc) topics of the
user’s work.
5. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented the current state of the ﬁeld of enter-
prise search together with several research ideas based on
the exploitation of semantic techniques in the context of en-
terprise search with the aim of improving the eﬀectivenessof the current enterprise search systems.
We plan to improve the eﬀectiveness of enterprise search
systems using techniques from Information Retrieval, Se-mantic Web and User Modelling ﬁelds. We want to make
the search experience independent from the structure and
type of the searched data, and dependent on the user. Thatis, customized on the user’s needs and characteristics and,
at the same time, broadly based on the whole enterprise.
