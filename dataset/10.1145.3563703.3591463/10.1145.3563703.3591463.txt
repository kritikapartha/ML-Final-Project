ABSTRACT 
From candles to prayer beads to icons and more, tangible artifacts 
have long played a central role in religious and spiritual life. How-
ever, despite growing interest in HCI on design within religious 
and spiritual contexts, the intentional design of tangible interac-
tive artifacts for religious or spiritual purposes is still relatively 
uncommon. This workshop aims at advancing our understand-
ing of tangible interactive artifact design in religious and spiritual 
contexts and how religious and spiritual purposes may ofer alter-
native approaches to design. We invite those interested from all 
professional and religious/spiritual backgrounds to imagine and de-
sign tangible interactive artifacts for religious or spiritual purposes 
such as beliefs, practices, or rituals. The workshop will include the 
demonstration of (imagined) artifacts, refection on designing for 
religious/spiritual purposes, and hands-on design sessions.

Designers have long created artifacts that align with non-religious 
purposes, such as to make our daily activities easier or more ef-
fcient (e.g., sharper axes, faster smartphones, more ergonomic 
vacuums, etc.). This pragmatic focus of design has been extremely 
successful in delivering many goods that improve our lives, but 
there are open questions about how the singular focus on these 
types of purposes, in design and in living, fall well short of sup-
plying full and rich lives [19]. This workshop ofers a possibility 
to explore an alternative approach to the design of artifacts used 
in our daily lives and to the purposes which guide design. More 
specifcally, this workshop aims at bringing together individuals 
who are engaged in (or interested in) designing for religious and 
spiritual purposes (e.g., increasing faith, investigating beliefs, sup-
porting spiritual practices, etc.) that have long held importance 
in individuals’ lives but are often neglected in traditional design 
processes. In its orientation toward alternative design goals and 
practices, this workshop shares much with aspects of the design 
futures proposed by slow design [6], refective design [20], and value 
sensitive design [4] but with a specifc focus on incorporating and 
supporting religious and spiritual purposes in the design of tangible 
interactive artifacts. Inspired by centuries of religious and spiritual 
wisdom and practices that utilize tangible artifacts (e.g., prayer 
beads, candles, altars, relics, etc.) to engage with the intangible (e.g., 
god, the divine, the transcendent, etc.), this workshop centers on 
the speculative creation of (and refection upon) tangible interactive 
artifacts for religious and spiritual purposes. 
While HCI has made strides around the concept of technospiritu-
ality [2], such as the design of a resource for the spiritual activity 
of cloistered nuns [5] or the utilization of interactive technologies 
to support Sabbath day observance among Orthodox Jewish fami-
lies [23], the intentional design of tangible interactive artifacts for 
religious or spiritual purposes is still relatively uncommon in HCI. 
Recent exceptions, however, include an interactive prayer altar in-
spired by Buddhist rituals [22] and the work of Hemmert et al. [9] 
who designed tangible user interfaces inviting novel engagements 
with Catholic beliefs. For example, to examine how "all humans 
are equal" could be explored and fostered through a tangible user 
117DIS Companion ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA Markum and Wolf, et al. 
interface, Hemmert et al. designed an interactive seesaw that coun-
terbalances people’s weight [9]. The proposed workshop draws 
inspiration from this speculative work around designing tangible 
interactive artifacts and invites potential participants to further 
explore how tangible interactive artifacts may support religious 
and spiritual purposes as well as shape, infuence, or inaugurate 
religious and spiritual practices. 
Through this workshop we seek to leverage the act of creation 
itself as a means of thinking and "giving form to formlessness" [1]. 
Building on theories of embodiment [e.g., 3, 11], we draw upon the 
power that creating tangible artifacts ofers in enabling the expres-
sion of tacit knowledge ("thinking through doing") and facilitating 
communication and understanding between religious and spiritual 
traditions. Religious and spiritual development is frequently the 
outgrowth of directed acts of attention, refection, contemplation, 
and practice [14, 18], and the design of a tangible interactive arti-
fact ofers a novel means of acting which may lead to new ways 
of "knowing". Additionally, these tangible interactive artifacts, and 
more specifcally the artifacts that will be created for this work-
shop, also become means by which we are able to express principles, 
beliefs, and values to others, through the artifacts’ meanings and 
the practices that surround them [ 15]. Thus, by bringing together 
practitioners, designers, and the artifacts they create, we utilize the 
method of "thinking through doing" in religious and spiritual con-
texts to reveal new understandings. We also ofer a space to engage 
in dialogues around artifacts created by individuals from diferent 
religious and spiritual traditions that may provide opportunities 
for further self- and interspiritual-understanding. 
2 WORKSHOP MOTIVATIONS AND THEMES 
This one-day, in-person workshop expands previous activities by 
the co-organizers in religious and spiritual contexts. Most notably, 
we aim to continue to support collaborative research and design 
work that explores, defnes, and contributes to a growing subfeld 
in HCI centered on design within religious and spiritual contexts 
[12, 17]. Through previous workshop activities, post-workshop anal-
ysis sessions, and the establishment of a transdisciplinary research 
and design collective (the Spirituality, Religion, and Interactive 
Technology Design (SPIRITED) Collective), we have sought to cre-
ate a space within the feld of HCI for the collaborative exploration 
of topics centered on religion and spirituality. One preliminary 
outcome has been a set of emerging core themes of what designing 
within religious or spiritual contexts might mean. Building on this 
previous work, the workshop will engage with some of the emerg-
ing themes and ofer them as a means for participants to explore 
the design of tangible interactive artifacts for religious or spiritual 
purposes. Those themes are: 
• centering the everyday and reframing design beyond formal 
religious/spiritual spaces and practices, 
• embracing openness, uncertainty, and ambiguity in design 
in religious/spiritual contexts, and 
• reshaping design by incorporating religious/spiritual values, 
rituals, and practices into design practices. 
The frst two themes ("centering the everyday" and "embracing 
openness") serve as inspiration for the design of the artifacts, while 
the third theme ("reshaping design") will provide structure for the activities in the workshop sessions. In terms of "centering the every-
day," we are motivated by providing space to explore HCI around 
the idea of lived religion [7, 13] and invite researchers, designers, 
and practitioners to consider how tangible interactive artifacts fo-
cused on religious and spiritual purposes can be embedded in the 
day-to-day lives of individuals. In the case of "embracing openness," 
we are inspired by the work of Gaver et al. [5] and the attempt 
to create "a design that leaves ample room for its users’ own in-
terpretations and appropriations" [5, p. 2056] and invite potential 
participants to consider how to intentionally design tangible inter-
active artifacts for religious and spiritual purposes that may invite 
or encourage responses or actions but don’t overdetermine them. 
The fnal theme, "reshaping design," will guide aspects of the work-
shop where we will invite refection and discussion that will ofer 
workshop participants a means to rethink design processes and 
outcomes as well as how a religious or spiritual tradition’s specifc 
purposes may afect the process of design itself. 
As such, this workshop, through the artifacts that will be cre-
ated and the activities and discussions that will take place in the 
workshop sessions, represents a means to collaboratively explore 
these emerging themes, to articulate new themes related to design 
within religious and spiritual contexts, to contribute to existing 
bodies of work on design practices, and to consider how the design 
of tangible interactive artifacts may support religious and spiritual 
purposes in everyday life. 
3 WORKSHOP GOALS 
Our goal of this workshop is to contribute to design in religious 
and spiritual contexts in four main ways. First, given that very 
few novel artifacts come into existence in religious and spiritual 
traditions through current interactive design practices (as compared 
to updated, revised, or digital versions of existing artifacts), the 
intentional creation of tangible interactive artifacts may reveal 
much about how and why artifacts appear in religious and spiritual 
contexts as well as how these artifacts may alter existing practices 
or ofer the means for completely new practices. Our workshop 
specifcally seeks to engage with perspectives and practices from 
multiple spiritual and religious traditions, including those that are 
not always considered in HCI research [8, 10, 16, 21]. 
Second, through the design and utilization of novel artifacts 
focused on specifc beliefs, practices, or rituals, there emerges the 
opportunity to reexamine the religious or spiritual purposes that 
inform the artifact’s design and use. That is, the designed artifact 
itself becomes a lens through which important questions may be 
posed that usually occur only in the abstract. Thus, the practice 
of designing a tangible interactive artifact and the opportunity to 
collaboratively explore the meaning and use of the created artifacts 
in the workshop gives individuals a new (and embodied) means to 
understanding. 
Third, the design of tangible interactive artifacts for religious 
and spiritual purposes can also reveal much about the practice of 
design, particularly how design motivations, frameworks, and goals 
may shift as a result of a specifc religious or spiritual framework. 
Thus, the creation of novel tangible interactive artifacts by the 
participants and their collective exploration through the workshop 
activities ofer a perfect opportunity for participants to explore how 
118Designing Tangible Interactive Artifacts for Religious and Spiritual Purposes DIS Companion ’23, July 10–14, 2023, Pitsburgh, PA, USA 
religious and spiritual life (and purposes) may afect the practice of 
design. 
Fourth, we seek to further explore and refne the current theo-
retically-deduced emerging themes from our previous work. The 
design of tangible interactive artifacts by participants from multi-
ple religious and spiritual traditions can ofer important support 
for (or correction to) these themes and provide guidance in the 
development and articulation of a core set of design principles and 
practices in religious and spiritual contexts. 
4 ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES 
The anticipated outcomes of this workshop are multiple. First, the 
workshop participants will have the opportunity to contribute 
their artifacts to a subsequent issue of the SPIRITED Collective 
zine. The development of the zine will allow for the participants 
to bring together their artifacts and to collectively articulate the 
religious/spiritual and design practices that were embedded in and 
evoked by their artifacts and the workshop activities. Second, fur-
ther exploration and discussion amongst the workshop participants 
and SPIRITED Collective members will culminate in the publication 
of a pictorial paper for the 2024 ACM International Conference on 
Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) that exhibits 
the artifacts, discusses their creation, and ofers a presentation of 
the core fndings from the workshop. Third, this deepening exam-
ination and analysis will lead to the publication of theory- and 
method-oriented papers for the 2024 ACM Designing Interactive 
Systems (DIS) Conference that will articulate the theoretical and 
empirical insights that have been gained over the previous three 
workshops and communicate the design methods and recommen-
dations that have emerged through this process. 
5 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION 
Inspired by religious and spiritual practices centered on the use of 
tangible artifacts (e.g., prayer beads, candles, altars, relics, etc.) in 
engaging with the intangible (e.g., god, the divine, the transcendent, 
etc.), this workshop explores the creation of tangible interactive 
artifacts for religious and spiritual purposes. We invite participants 
to design novel tangible interactive artifacts for religious/spiritual 
purposes (e.g., beliefs, practices, and rituals) while considering the 
following themes: 
• centering the everyday and reframing design beyond formal 
religious/spiritual spaces and practices, and 
• embracing openness, uncertainty, and ambiguity in design 
in religious/spiritual contexts. 
The presentation of the artifacts (1-3 pages) may take the form 
of (among other things) pictorials, annotated portfolios, sketched 
visions, or written descriptions and should state what religious/spir-
itual purpose their artifact engages with and how. In the artifact’s 
design, participants can pursue goals such as support, exploration, 
refection, or provocation. For example, participants could design 
an artifact that fosters the development of a specifc quality in daily 
life (e.g., patience in the Christian tradition or generosity (dana)¯ in 
the Buddhist tradition). We invite participants from all backgrounds 
to submit artifacts drawing on their own religious/spiritual expe-
riences and purposes, those addressed in their research, or those 
encountered in everyday life. We particularly welcome artifacts e
xploring novel methods of engagement with religious/spiritual 
purposes. We ask participants to submit the presentation of their 
artifact via email to futureofparticipation@gmail.com. 
For the workshop, participants may create their artifact and 
bring it with them for exhibition and demonstration or may demon-
strate the potential practice around the artifact via role-play, paper 
prototype, wizard of Oz prototype, functional prototype, etc.
