ABSTRACT
While many studies have focused on students’ performance in CS1
courses, research related to the performance and persistence of
students in CS2 classes is not as widely performed. In this work, we
will extend our previous work to examine students’ performance
in CS2. We examined a data set that spanned over seven years
on more than 5300 student records. In addition to typical factors
studied by others (i.e. gender, race, CS1 performance), our work
also took into account the relationship between various CS1 path-
ways to CS2, student major, and the number of previous college
CS courses (including transfer credits) and student performance in
CS2. CS1 grade is a good indicator of performance in CS2. Gender
was not a significant factor in determining performance in CS2 and
undeclared engineering majors stood out as high performers. CS
majors passed the course at higher rates than other majors. Our
large data set allowed for more granular analysis according to race
and ethnicity and additional access to students’ underserved status.
Race and ethnicity had a significant correlation with performance,
and so did the underserved status. Our large data set confirmed
some of the findings of our previous work, while providing some
new insight.

1 INTRODUCTION
CS Educators are interested in understanding factors that contribute
to students’ success in computer science courses. The hope is that
by further understanding student performance and persistence in
computers science courses, the development of curriculum, instruc-
tion, and supports can be improved to increase overall performance

computing professionals and a computer science education can
open doors for many students. Both CS1 and CS2 are gateway
courses that are critical in attracting and preparing students for
degrees in computer science.
Many previous studies focus on the factors that impact success
in CS1 such as psychometrics, external factors, and previous expe-
riences [ 10]. Fewer studies have focused on student performance
in CS2. The most commonly studied predictor of success in CS2
is performance in CS1. Previous research has also examined prior
math experience, demographics, self-efficacy, and other course re-
lated analysis [2, 5, 8, 14, 25, 26]. In our previous CS2 analysis, we
analyzed persistence and performance of 610 students in a single
semester. We introduced two new factors that had not been studied
in the past. These factors are 1) pathways to CS2 (AP CS, institution
CS1, transfer credits, non-standard pathways) and 2) the number
of CS courses that a student has taken before arriving at CS2 [15].
With our larger data set of 5,300 CS2 students over the span of
seven years, we revisit analysis of factors such as CS1 performance,
gender, and major with this larger data set. We also investigate
race and ethnicity with increased granularity. Additionally, our
larger data set provides indicators for whether students are under-
served, so we consider that as an additional factor related to CS2
performance.
2 PREVIOUS RESEARCH
A plethora of studies have examined the factors that influence
success in introductory CS courses with the ultimate goal of de-
termining interventions to improve student success early in the
CS pipeline [ 14,25]. In previous studies, various factors have been
investigated and several metrics are commonly used to indicate
student success, the most common being course grade. The most
commonly studied predictors are engagement and performance
in previous courses. Demographic and psychometric factors such
as self-regulation and self-efficacy have also been studied [ 14,25].
Beck et al. recently attempted to determine specific CS1 exam ques-
tions that can assess students’ readiness for success in CS2 [2].
Bergin et al. determined that both mathematics preparation in
high school and self-regulation correlated positively with success
in CS1 [ 3,4,24]. Alavardo et al. have shown that students with AP
credits have higher grades across many CS courses [ 1]. Catanese et
al. have shown that transfer students perform well in higher level
computer science courses as non-transfer students [7].
CS1 course performance has been repeatedly show to predict
CS2 course performance [ 5,8,19]. Our previous study on a single
semester of data from this course verified these findings and also in-
dicated that gender and race were not significantly correlated with
896SIGCSE 2023, March 15–18, 2023, Toronto, ON, Canada Margaret Ellis & Sara Hooshangi
whether students passed, did not pass, or dropped the course. How-
ever, undeclared engineering majors stood out as high performers
and students’ CS pathway leading to CS2 was also significant. Stu-
dents with CS1 transfer credits had significantly lower pass rates,
while students with only one previous CS course credit were less
likely to drop or not pass the course [15].
Our larger data set provides the opportunity to analyze success
rates for more specific races. The National Center for Education
Statistics data indicates that both Black and Hispanic students are
less likely to finish a bachelor’s degree within four years relative
to their White and Asian peers [ 11]. George et al. paints a more
complex picture of persistence specific to computing and based
on student interest according to race. Two years after taking an
introductory computing course, the Asian/Asian American group
was the only race/ethnicity variable that was statistically significant
in predicting interest in a computing career [13].
Our larger data set provides information about whether or not
a student is considered underserved. Students who are identified
as underserved at our university include students who are first
generation college students, receive Pell Grant funding, or identify
as veterans. These three populations have unique characteristics but
all experience an academic performance gap [ 6,13,16,17,30,36].
A review of a CS2 course containing 86 students at Humbloldt State
University reported a variation in course success rates for specific
sub-populations. The first generation students had a 70.6% pass
rate, while the not first generation students had a 82.1% success
rate. Students in that course receiving financial aide only had a
69.8% success rate, compared to the 84.8% success rate for students
who received no financial aide [21].
Many studies have demonstrated student success is affected
by multiple factors including students’ previous experience, self-
efficacy and sense-of-belonging. Prior computing experience such
as internships, co-curricular activities, or high school program-
ming courses can significantly impact a student’s experience in a
computer science course [23]. In Rountree’s study, expectancy for
success was the strongest single indicator of success in a CS1 course,
more so than demographics and background [ 27]. Krauss-Levy et
al. found that a lower sense of belonging was negatively correlated
with course performance and pass rates [18].
Students from minoritized groups tend to experience lower self
efficacy and sense of belonging. For example, Krauss-Levy et al’s
found that women, first generations students and transfer students
had a lower sense of belonging [ 18]. In a study of over 100 institu-
tions, black and female students were more likely to have communal
goal orientation and to have a weaker sense of belonging with com-
puting [ 20]. Also, controlling for race and gender, Nguyen and
Lewis found that competitive enrollment was a negative predictor
of sense of belonging and self-efficacy for students without prior
experience [22].
Other research has focused on examining the WDF rate and
improving that ratio post-intervention [ 31]. WDF is the percentage
of students receiving a grade of “D” or “F”, or withdrawing from the
course before the course ends. Further research into the factors that
influence WDF can shed light on effective intervention methods
that could impact students who are in the danger of exiting the CS
pipeline.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
This project aims to examine different factors that are correlated
with student performance and retention in CS2. Our research ques-
tions are the following as a replication study with a larger data
set:
•RQ1: Are demographic factors such as gender, race, student’s
major, and underserved status correlated with performance
(passing or failing) CS2?
•RQ2: Is CS1 grade correlated with CS2 performance?
•RQ3: Is CS1 pathway to CS2 (standard CS1 at our institution
or transfer credit for CS1) correlated with performance in
CS2?
4 INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND
Our institution is a large research university located in United
States with more than 30,000 undergraduate students and a rapidly
growing CS department. Computer Science is one of 13 departments
within the College of Engineering (COE). Students are admitted to
the College of Engineering and are considered General Engineering
majors (referred to in this paper as undeclared engineering) in their
first year. They can declare a major within the college after their
first year. All students in computer science major or minor are
required to take our standard CS2 course which is taught in Java.
4.1 CS2 Pathways
The software and programming sequence of courses for our CS
majors and minors is CS1 (Introduction to Software Design), CS2
(Introduction to Data Structures and Software Design), and CS3
(Data Structures and Algorithms) all taught in Java with no previous
experience required in CS1. However, many students enter CS2 by
satisfying the prerequisite with a course other than the standard
CS1 course offered to CS majors at our institution.
Students may have earned credit for CS1 during high school
by passing the APCS A exam, taking a dual enrollment computer
science course, or a CS course at an International Baccalaureate (IB)
High School. Some students may earn CS1 transfer credits directly
from another university or a community college. Students in other
majors at our institution can take an introductory course in Java or
a sequence of Python courses before enrolling in CS2.
4.2 Dataset
This study focuses on the examination of students who took CS2
between Fall 2015 and Spring 2022. The course was heavily updated
in the Fall of 2015 and underwent subtle improvements over the
years, with a reorganization in Spring 2020 to address needs to
deliver the course online and to incorporate an increased number of
smaller coding practice opportunities. The objectives of the course,
projects, and tests remained very similar over this seven year period.
Data was acquired from the University Registrar’s office upon
IRB approval. We only focused on students who attempted and
received a grade for CS2 between Fall 2015 and Spring 2022. Table 1
shows the gender, race/ethnicity, and underserved status distribu-
tion of students who completed the course. A total of 5316 students
were included in our data set. Gender and race distributions are
similar to the composition of the CS undergraduate population in
our department. For race, we have used similar categories found
897Replication and Expansion Study on Factors Influencing Student Performance in CS2 SIGCSE 2023, March 15–18, 2023, Toronto, ON, Canada
in other Computing Research Association (CRA) publications, but
our data does not separate non-resident students from domestic
students. We used the National Science Foundation [ 12] definition
of underrepresented minorities in the STEM field, where Hispanic
of any race is categorized as Hispanic. Other/mixed category in-
cludes racial and ethnic groups combined (American Indians or
Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, and
individuals who report more than one race and are not Hispanic).
Students without a disclosed race are marked as Not Reported in our
tables and figures. At our institution, non-international students
are reported as underserved based on any one of three factors, 1)
neither parent completed a bachelor’s degree, commonly referred
to as first-generation students, or 2) qualify for a Pell Grant based
on the Free Application for Federal Student Aide (FAFSA), or 3)
self-identify as veterans and receive GI benefit while enrolled [ 29].

Figure 1 shows the trend in our CS2 enrollment over the seven
years of analyzed data. We see a steady increase in the number of
students who enroll in CS2 each year, consistent with the growth
that has been observed in the number of undergraduate CS students
in our department. Each vertical bar represents total enrollment for
fall, spring, and summer in an academic year. For 21-22 academic
year, the data for summer enrollment was not available at the time
of this analysis. This contributes to the lower number of students
shown for that academic year. The percentage of female students
averages around 20% over the seven years, with a slight increase
over the past three years, from 17% in 2019-2022 academic year to
23% in 2021-2022 academic year.
For this data set we also had indicators for whether a student
was underserved as defined earlier. Overall, 19% of students were
underserved across the data set. The percentage of students who
have an underserved status has fluctuated over the years, with its
peak at 23% in 2016-2017 academic year, dropping to 16% in 2020-
2021, and then slowly increasing to 19% at the end of 2021-2022
academic year. Figure 2 shows the trend in our CS2 enrollment by
underserved status over the seven years of data.
5 RESULTS
For our 7-year CS2 data set, we analyzed the following factors: gen-
der, race, student major, CS1 pathway, number of CS courses taken
Figure 1: CS2 enrollment over the years by gender
Figure 2: CS2 enrollment by underserved status
before CS2, underserved status, and CS1 grade. We investigated
the relationship between these factors and CS2 grades. We also
analyzed the correlation of these factors with whether students
passed the course or received a WDF. For this course, students must
earn a C or better to proceed to the next course, so C- students
were categorized in the WDF group.
5.1 RQ1: Are demographic factors such as
gender, race, student’s major, and
underserved status correlated with
performance (passing or failing) CS2?
To examine demographic factors (gender, race, major, and under-
served status) that may be correlated with student performance
in CS2, we looked at each of these factors separately and exam-
ined the performance of students belonging to each group within a
given factor. A few students had received atypical grades such as
incomplete, repeat or no grade. To simplify our analysis, we had
removed these few cases from our data set before any analysis.

Table 2 shows passing rate based on binary gender. The number
of female students in our CS2 class is consistent with the overall
rate of female students in our department. The result of this table
suggests that male and female students are performing similarly in
the course, and passing at the same rate.
Table 2: Pass/fail rate based on gender
Gender Pass WDF Total
Male 3968 (93.4%) 282 (6.6%) 4250 (100.0%)
Female 999 (94.4%) 59 (5.6%) 1058 (100.0%)
Unknown 8(100%) 0 (0.0%) 8 (100.0%)
Total 4975 (93.4%) 341 (6.4%) 5316 (100.0%)
We further analyzed the relationship between gender and per-
formance by running a Chi-squared analysis based on two possible
CS2 outcomes; passing or not passing (WDF). Our analysis reveals
that for gender ( 𝜒2=2.13,𝑝=.34), there is no significant differ-
ence between CS2 outcome. This is consistent with the result of
our previous study, where we saw no correlation between gender
and performance [15].
We also looked at race and ethnicity as a factor that may be
correlated with performance in the class. Figure 3 shows the grade
distribution for various demographic groups as box-plots. Table 3
shows passing rate based on race/ethnicity. The initial analysis
of these results indicates that Hispanic and Black students are
passing at a slightly lower rate than Asian and White students. To
further examine this observation, we ran a Chi-squared analysis
that indicated a significant difference based on these race/ethnicity
categories (𝜒2=17.65,𝑝=.003).
Figure 3: CS2 performance based on race/ethnicity
We further analyzed our result by performing pairwise Chi-
square analysis between Black/White, Black/Asian, Hispanic/White
and Hispanic/Asian students. The pairwise comparison showed
a significant difference between Black students’ rate of passing
when compared to White students ( 𝜒2=6.97,𝑝=.008) and Asian
students (𝜒2=6.65,𝑝=.009). Similarly Hispanic students’ passing
rate when compared to White students ( 𝜒2=8.35,𝑝=.003) and
Asian students ( 𝜒2=7.85,𝑝=.005) were significant. No significantdifference was observed between Asian and White students, as
expected from the passing rates shown Table 3. These results, which
were possible to obtain with the larger data set, demonstrate that
further research and interventions are needed to support Black and
Hispanic students.
Table 3: Pass/fail rate based on race/ethnicity
Race Pass WDF Total
White 2305 (94.2%) 142 ( 5.8%) 2447 (100%)
Asian 1812 (94.2%) 112 ( 5.8%) 1924 (100.0%)
Hispanic 282 (89.8%) 32 (10.2%) 314 (100.0%)
Other/Mixed 252 (92.3%) 21 ( 7.7%) 273 (100.0%)
Black 184 (89.3%) 22 (10.7%) 206 (100.0%)

Total 4975 (93.4%) 341 (6.4%) 5316 (100.0%)
We also looked at how students’ major was correlated with per-
formance. Figure 4 shows CS2 grade distribution for different ma-
jors. In this analysis, we separated the majors into four categories:
"CS" for students majoring in computer science; "Other STEM",
for students majoring in a STEM field other than CS’ "Undeclared
Engineering", for freshmen students in the College of Engineering
who are yet to declare a major, and finally "Other" to account for
students who are not in any STEM fields. The graph indicates that
undeclared engineering students have the highest average grade
followed by CS majors, which is the same order determined in the
Spring 2021 data set [15].
Figure 4: CS2 performance based on major
Table 4 shows passing rate based on major. The CS students
are passing at higher rates (98.3%) than other majors, followed by
undeclared engineering students. The students coming from non-
STEM fields have the highest rate of failure. To further examine
this result, we ran a Chi-squared analysis which indicated that a
significant difference is observed based on major ( 𝜒2=150.7,𝑝<
.001). We further analyzed our data by performing pairwise Chi-
square analysis between all major pairs and in all cases the p-
value was less than 0.001. While the performance of undeclared
engineering majors is higher than CS students, overall CS students
899Replication and Expansion Study on Factors Influencing Student Performance in CS2 SIGCSE 2023, March 15–18, 2023, Toronto, ON, Canada
are passing at a higher rate than others. The students from non-
STEM majors had the highest rate of failure relative to any other
demographic group analyzed (14%) and more interventions should
be considered to increase their success in CS2.
Table 4: Pass/fail rate based on student’s major
Major Pass WDF Total
CS 1270 (98.3%) 22 ( 1.7%) 1292 (100.0%)
Undeclared Eng 1706 (95.8%) 75 ( 4.2%) 1781 (100.0%)
Other STEM 1458 (90.3%) 156 ( 9.7%) 1614 (100.0%)
Other 541 (86.0%) 88 (14.0%) 629 (100.0%)
Finally, we looked at the relationship between underserved sta-
tus and performance in the CS2 class. As shown in Table 1, 19% of
students are considered underserved. The average grade for these
students is similar to other groups, and we see no difference in the
distribution of their CS2 grades. However Table 5 shows that the
passing rate is slightly less for those in the underserved category.
We further analyzed the relationship between underserved status
and performance by running a Chi-squared analysis. Our analy-
sis reveals that for the underserved status, there is a significant
difference between CS2 passing outcome ( 𝑐ℎ𝑖2=11.23,𝑝<.001).
These results, which were possible to obtain with the underserved
indicator in this data set, demonstrate that further research and
interventions are needed to support students who are considered
underserved.

Unknown 6 (100.0%) 0(0.0%) 6 (100.0%)
5.2 RQ2: Is CS1 grade correlated with CS2
performance?
For our data set, CS1 grade reasonably predicts CS2 grade. Figure 5
shows the relationship between CS1 grade and CS2 grade. Students
need a grade of C or better in CS1 before they can complete CS2,
hence the grade distribution for CS1 only includes the range of C
to A grades. As shown in Figure 5, the grades of students who took
CS1 at our institution are correlated with their CS2 grades. This
correlation is statistically significant with a p< .001 and a correlation
coefficient of 0.42. The mean grade for CS1 is 3.06 and 3.14 for CS2.
As shown in the box-plot, there is more variation in performance
for students who received a lower CS1 grade, but overall CS1 grade
is a significant factor in CS2 grade. These findings align well with
many previous studies that have correlated CS1 and CS2 grade as
discussed in Section 2.
Figure 5: CS2 performance based on CS1 grades
5.3 RQ3: Is CS1 pathway to CS2 (standard CS1 at
our institution or transfer credit for CS1)
correlated with performance in CS2?
Students reach our CS2 classes from a variety of different academic
pathways. Based on information provided in our data set, we created
three categories to indicate student pathway to CS2 as follows:
"CS1" for our traditional CS1 path; "CC Transfer" for community
college transfer credit; "Other Transfer" for transfer credit from all
other sources. "Other Transfer" encompasses AP CS, IB, four year
institution transfers, and other pathways at our institution, but
this granularity was not available at the time of analysis. Table 6
summarizes students’ path to CS2 for these groups. About two-
thirds of our students take our CS1 course, and the rest transfer the
credit into our program.
We also looked into the number of prior CS college-level courses
that a student had credit for before enrolling in CS2. In the 7-year
data set, 90% of students came to CS2 from a single college course,
which in all likelihood is CS1 or an equivalent transfer credit. Mean-
while, 7% came with 2 previous courses, and only 3% had taken 3
or more courses before enrolling in CS2. There was less variation
in the number of previous CS courses the students had taken in
the larger historical data set than in the recent single semester
data set where 31% of the students had credit for 2 or 3 previous
college-level CS courses.
Table 6: Pass/fail rate based on CS1 pathway

Total 4975 (93.6%) 341 (6.4%) 5316 (100.0%)
*CC: Community College
We further analyzed the relationship between groups in each
factor by running a Chi-squared analysis on each factor. Our Chi-
squared analysis reveals that for neither CS1 pathway ( 𝜒2=0.44,𝑝=
.93), nor number of prior CS courses ( 𝜒2=0.02,𝑝=1.0), was sig-
nificantly correlated with CS2 grade. This is in contrast to what we
900SIGCSE 2023, March 15–18, 2023, Toronto, ON, Canada Margaret Ellis & Sara Hooshangi
observed in our previous study on a single recent semester [ 15],
where we saw a significance difference. We partially attribute this
to the fact that there is now more variation in students’ CS1 course
and number of prior CS courses which is thus not reflected in the
larger, more historic data set. Recognizing this changing landscape
is a reminder to continue researching how to support students with
various CS college course pathways to CS2.
6 DISCUSSION
In this follow-up paper, we revisited several factors that may be
correlated with student performance in a CS2 class on a large data
set that spanned over seven years and contained more than 5300
student records. Our analysis corroborates previous research on
some of the predictors of CS2 performance and also provides some
new and specific insights that can be further investigated. CS1
grades are significant factors in our students’ CS2 performance. Our
results confirm findings in previous studies [ 5,8,10] and also our
own previous one-semester study [ 15] in this regard. Furthermore,
we saw no evidence of gender as being a significant factor in student
performance or passing rate for this CS2 course. Prior works have
also shown no correlation between gender and performance in
introductory CS courses [33, 34].
On the other hand, we found race and ethnicity to be correlated
with student performance in this CS2 course over the 7 year time
frame. The lower passing rate of these students is also indicative
that Black and Hispanic students are at a disadvantage when com-
pared to their White and Asian peers, and risk dropping out of the
CS pipeline at a higher rates. Further work needs to be done to
support Black and Hispanic students in our CS2 course. It is possible
these students’ performance is affected by their level of previous
experience, self-efficacy, and sense-of-belonging, all of which can
be interrelated and affect academic performance [ 18,23,27,28].
More research and interventions need to be undertaken. For ex-
ample, if these students have communal goal orientation and a
weaker sense of belonging similar to students in [ 20] then possibly
volunteering opportunities, mentoring, and group projects may
improve sense of belonging and thus performance. A psychological
intervention that is designed to instill that hardship and doubt are
common to all CS2 students regardless of race may also be able to
improve Black students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy and
thus performance [32].
In addition, student’s major was also a significant factor in pre-
dicting CS2 grade. While undeclared engineering students, who
are College of Engineering students who have not yet declared
a specific major, had a higher average grade in CS2, overall CS
majors had the higher rate of passing the course. The difference
in passing rate between various major categories in this study (CS,
undeclared engineering, other STEM, and other) was significant.
This indicates that CS students are passing CS2 at a higher rate. In
our previous study [ 15], we saw that the undeclared engineering
group outperformed others and passed at a higher rate. There is
now a larger and higher performing percentage of undeclared engi-
neering students who are taking CS2. These students are 34% of the
7-year population and 52% of the Spring 2021 population. Placing
CS2 students in cohorts may help improve the performance of the
other STEM majors and other majors similarly to how Decker sawa decreased WDF rate in CS1 when students were placed in cohorts
based on previous experience [9].
Underserved status was also significantly correlated with the
passing rate of a student. Students who were considered under-
served passed at a lower rate, and this indicates that intervention
or support mechanisms should be put in place to provide support
to these groups. Transparent teaching strategies as outlined by
Winkelmes et al. could improve confidence, sense of belonging, and
mastery of skills for low-income and underrepresented CS2 stu-
dents [ 35]. For example, ensuring that problem-based assignments
clearly state knowledge gained and skills practiced that are relevant
to students 5 years in the future.
We saw no significant difference between students who trans-
ferred CS1 credit from a community college. In our previous study
students who transferred CS1 credit had a lower passing rate. Our
analysis on the larger historic data set is more aligned with work
by Catanese et al. that showed transfer students perform as well as
non-transfer students in computing courses [ 7]. It is possible that
historically transfer students transfer CS1 credit, but more recently
an increased number of non-transfer students also obtain credit
outside our institution. Unfortunately, our data set did not indicate
transfer student status and did not have enough granularity to
examine the specific source of all possible CS1 pathways.
6.1 Threats to Validity
Because there are no defined experimental and control groups in
this study, a direct causality between process measurements and
our outcomes cannot be inferred. Differential experience could be
a potential threat to this study, as students come from diverse aca-
demic backgrounds. Our findings are based on data for students
at a larger research institution. As such our results might not be
generalizable to all undergraduate students. However, the charac-
teristics of our students are representative of typical undergraduate
students who enroll in CS2 offered at large research institutions in
the United States.
7 CONCLUSION
This is a replication study using a large data set over many years
of student records. We verified that CS1 grade is a good indicator
of CS2 performance, and that gender is not correlated with perfor-
mance. We found that Black and Hispanic students pass CS2 at a
lower rate and more attention must given to their success in CS2
classes. Students who have already declared a CS major pass the
course at higher rates than other majors. Further study is needed
to understand current students’ prior pathways and computing
experience before enrolling in CS2. Further study is also needed to
investigate these factors, not just in isolation, but in conjunction
with one another and previous computing experience. Student self-
efficacy and sense of belonging should also be considered in order
to better understand how to support students for success in CS2.
