ABSTRACT
B-cell epitope prediction for antipeptide paratopes is key to
developing novel vaccines and immunodiagnostics. This entails
estimating free-energy changes for paratope binding to variable-
length disordered peptidic sequences as has been previously
described for the Heuristic Affinity Prediction Tool for Immune
Complexes (HAPTIC), which resolves said binding into processes of
epitope compaction, collapse and contact by analogy to
protein folding. However, HAPTIC analyzes antigen sequence data
without excluding potentially problematic candidate epitopes (e.g.,
comprising inaccessible and/or conformationally rigid residues)
while also neglecting the temperature dependence of polyproline
II (PPII) helix propensity (for compaction), occurrence of epitope-
backbone hydrogen bonding and impact of disulfide bond
formation between epitope cysteine residues. The present work thus
provides a more physically realistic revision of HAPTIC
(HAPTIC2), the HAPTIC2-like Epitope Prediction Tool for
Antigen with Disulfide (HEPTAD) and the HAPTIC2/HEPTAD
Input Preprocessor (HIP), forming the HAPTIC2/HEPTAD User
Toolkit (HUT). HIP facilitates tagging of residues (e.g., in
hydrophobic blobs, ordered regions and glycosylation motifs) for
exclusion from downstream analyses by HAPTIC2 and HEPTAD.
HAPTIC2 enables temperature-dependent PPII helix propensity
calculations while also regarding glycine and proline as polar
residues that form hydrogen bonds with paratopes. HEPTAD
analyzes antigen sequences that each contain two cysteine residues
for which the impact of disulfide pairing is estimated as a
correction to the free-energy penalty of compaction. All
components of HUT (i.e., HIT, HAPTIC2 and HEPTAD) are freely
accessible online (http://badong.freeshell.org/hut.htm).
