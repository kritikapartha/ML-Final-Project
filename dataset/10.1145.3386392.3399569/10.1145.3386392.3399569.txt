ABSTRACT
With increasing diversity in the labor market as well as the work
force, employers receive resumes from an increasingly diverse pop-
ulation. However, studies and field experiments have confirmed
the presence of bias in the labor market based on gender, race,
and ethnicity. Many employers use automated resume screening
to filter the many possible matches. Depending on how the auto-
mated screening algorithm is trained it can potentially exhibit bias
towards a particular population by favoring certain socio-linguistic
characteristics. The resume writing style and socio-linguistics are a
potential source of bias as they correlate with protected characteris-
tics such as ethnicity. A biased dataset is often translated into biased
AI algorithms and de-biasing algorithms are being contemplated.
In this work, we study the effects of socio-linguistic bias on resume
to job description matching algorithms. We develop a simple tech-
nique, called fair-tf-idf, to match resumes with job descriptions in
a fair way by mitigating the socio-linguistic bias.

1 INTRODUCTION
According to Glassdoor, a popular job search engine and a review
site, on an average a company receives around 250 resumes for each
job posting, and the number can be even higher for Fortune 500
companies. Out of these, only four to six qualified candidates are
called for an interview [ 11]. As the internet became the preferred
place for posting as well as accepting job applications, an increasing

https://doi.org/10.1145/3386392.3399569number of companies have started using software for filtering out
the resumes. Only a handful of qualified candidate resumes are
actually seen by recruiters or hiring managers. According to a
study published in 2015, almost 75% of the recruiters and/or talent
managers use software for recruiting or applicant tracking [ 14]. The
recruiting software is trained on a training dataset that is subject to
biases in the actual process of hiring, which may be transferred [ 1].
Studies in the past have proven that discrimination based on gender
[5], race [ 4], and ethnicity [ 16] is prevalent in job market even when
the employer claims to be an “Equal Opportunity Employer.” If the
training data, which consists of details of actual hired candidates,
is not diverse enough, the resulting software can produce biased
recommendations [ 8]. Linguistic and accent differences are a major
contribution in generating prejudiced impressions against women,
minority groups or non-native speakers [6].
We center our study on discriminatory behavior in the auto-
mated matching component of the hiring process regarding the
origin country of the applicants, potentially arising from socio-
linguistic tendencies. To mitigate the socio-linguistic bias in resume
screening process, we propose de-biasing methods that penalize
matching keywords that are typical to one section of society while
encouraging matching keywords that are common among all de-
mographics. Five different methods are evaluated based on fairness
and accuracy measures. The experiments show that our proposed
method, fair-tf-idf with Sigmoid Transformation, provides an ad-
justable balance between accuracy and fairness, and leads to the
most desirable fairness/accuracy result according to our criteria.
2 RELATED WORK
In the past, many studies have been conducted which demonstrated
the bias in recruitment with respect to gender, race, ethnicity or
the accents of the applicants. Some of the studies focused on racial
discrimination in the recruitment process, e.g. [ 4], which confirmed
the presence of bias in labor market based on race.
[4] demonstrated that interview calls received were almost 50%
higher for white sounding names compared African-American
sounding names. They further show that by increasing the quality
of resumes the interview calls were increased by 30% for white
sounding names as compared to a marginal increase for African-
American sounding names. Another such study conducted in 2009
targeted racial as well as ethnic discrimination in a job market in
Canada [16].
In the book “Weapons of Math Destruction” [ 15], O’Neil dis-
cusses a personality test conducted by companies before hiring
the candidates which was designed by experts that may not take
into account any feedback. Candidates who get red-lighted as a
result of this automated screening test suffer without knowing the
reason. She also explains in detail how the bias in training data

and Personalization (FairUMAP 2020)

268(past human decisions in this case) is inherited by machine learning
algorithms. O’Neil illustrates this with an example of the screening
process of a medical school which was highly biased [ 13]. When
the school decided to build a computer model for screening the ap-
plicants, they captured the bias from previous human decisions and
the resulting algorithm discriminated against non-native English
speaking candidates and female candidates [13].
Rudinger et al., in 2017 [ 17] studied social bias in natural lan-
guage inference corpora and how it is susceptible to amplifica-
tion. They demonstrated that the hypotheses of Stanford Natural
Language Inference (SNLI) consist of various types of stereotypes
including gender-based, age-based, racial or religious bias.
While the previous studies were mostly field experiments and
did not talk about their application to training a machine learning
algorithm, numerous recent studies have been conducted to find out
the impact of biased data on the trained machine learning models
[1]. Numerous debiasing methods have been proposed, several of
which are summarized by [ 3]. Notable studies that have addressed
“fairness” focused on two different approaches. Some studies like
Feldman et. al. [ 9] proposed methods to make the the dataset unbi-
ased, whereas others like Bolukbasi et. al. [ 5] proposed a debiasing
algorithm for achieving fairness. [ 5] showed that word embeddings
trained on very general input data like news articles display gender-
biased word associations. They proposed an algorithm to “de-bias”
the word embeddings to reduce gender stereotypical associations.
While previous works including [ 2,5] have proposed debiasing
algorithms for text data, they mainly focused on word embeddings.
Our method instead focuses on debiasing tf-idf representations.
3 DATASET
We studied nationality bias in automated resume filtering in the
context of a relatively pluralistic nation, Singapore. The popula-
tion of Singapore consists of three major ethnic groups: Chinese,
Malaysian and Indian. Around 43% of its population consists of
foreign born people. As we wanted to study the socio-linguistic bias,
which can be a result of the different linguistic styles being used in
different countries, we selected the resumes of candidates born in
China, Malaysia and India. We used 135 resumes of candidates ap-
plying to accounting and finance jobs in Singapore collected by Jai
Janyani,1consisting of 45 candidates each from Chinese, Malaysian
and Indian origin, the primary demographics in Singapore. We
manually selected the resumes from the said dataset based on care-
fully reading and understanding the origin of candidates. Only the
resumes where origin of the candidates can be clearly inferred were
selected for this study. The categorization of resumes into Chinese,
Indian or Malaysian origin was done based on the education or ini-
tial employment records. For example, candidates were categorized
as Chinese origin if they have completed all or initial education
in China and/or have started their employment in China and then
moved to Singapore or applied for a job in Singapore.
To assess and mitigate the bias in matching job descriptions
and resumes, we manually collected 9 finance and accounting job
postings from a popular job site with 3 postings from each country
(China, India and Malaysia). Although our focus is on nationality-
based AI hiring discrimination in Singapore, we used the job ads

job postings, based on tf-idf features.
posted by people from those countries since we could use the na-
tional origin as a ground truth label for the nationality of the people
who posted the ads. Finally, all job-resume pairs were annotated
according to whether the candidate was qualified for the job (a
binary label), by three annotators. The majority vote was used to
determine the final ground truth label regarding whether the can-
didate was a “match” for the job or not. The aim of the study is to
match the resumes with the job postings in an unbiased way irre-
spective of the country in which they were posted. For example, for
a job posting from China, the possibility of resumes getting selected
from all the three countries should be equal and only depend on
the qualifications of candidates rather than their country of origin.
4 THE BIAS EXPLAINED
An AI-based resume filtering algorithm aims to find resumes that
match the job postings. The standard text-based document retrieval
approach [ 12] uses tf-idf vectors to represent each query and each
document [ 10]. In our case, a job advertisement is considered a
“query” and a resume is a document to retrieve. We rank the match
of a resume and a job posting based on the cosine similarity of the
job posting vector and the resume vector. In our experiments, we
selected the top 5 resumes for a particular job posting based on the
cosine similarity between them. Our first goal is to examine the
fairness behavior of this standard approach.
It was observed that out of all the resumes selected by our algo-
rithm, around 46.66% were from Malaysia, 42.22% were from India,
while Chinese resumes formed only 11.11% of the total selected
resumes. To formally define and quantify fairness, we used the
following𝑝% Fairness Measure in our study:
𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 =𝑃(𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1)
𝑃(𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2), (1)
Session 5: Fairness in User Modeling, Adaptation 
and Personalization (FairUMAP 2020) 
 
UMAP ’20 Adjunct, July 14–17, 2020, Genoa, Italy
269Table 1: Fairness Measure and Accuracy for Tf-idf
Country (of Job Posting) Fairness Measure Accuracy
China 0.7272 90
India 0.0526 80
Malaysia 0.0526 100
Overall 0.0723 90
where𝑃(𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1)is the value from the demographic
with the lowest match probability value given a fixed demographic
of job posting and 𝑃(𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2)is the value from the
demographic with the highest match probability value given a fixed
demographic of job posting.
This widely used fairness metric is adapted from the 80% rule
for disparate impact analysis, a legal criterion which identifies
discriminatory behavior if the ratio is less than 0.8 [ 7]. Here, the𝑝%
is expressed as a ratio between 0 and 1, rather than a percentage.
The lower the value of Fairness Measure, the more “unfair” it is
in terms of disparity. We found that the fairness properties varied
greatly with respect to the country of the job posting (Table 1).
The overall fairness measure across all job postings came out to be
0.0723, very far below the legal threshold of 0.8.
To evaluate the accuracy of the matching process, we labeled all
possible job-candidate matches using the majority vote from our
three annotators. For this part of the experiment, we considered
only the top 5 resumes retrieved. The accuracy of the tf-idf method
varied by country but was generally high, being 90% accurate overall
(Table 1).
We used a𝑡-SNE plot [ 18] to visualize all the tf-idf representa-
tions of resumes and job postings together in two dimensions in
order to better understand the tf-idf algorithm’s disparate behavior
(Figure 1). We observe substantial clustering of resumes by national
origin, especially for the Chinese resumes. It is visible that many
job postings are closer to Malaysian-origin resumes, whereas fewer
postings were near Chinese origin resumes. Also, it can be seen that
Chinese job postings are closer to Chinese origin resumes than any
other job postings, making it difficult to match Chinese resumes
to non-Chinese ads. These factors may partly explain the large
differences in the fairness metrics between countries.
To more closely examine the reasons for these demographic
differences, we plotted word clouds to show the top words used by
applicants from each country of origin. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show word
clouds for China, India and Malaysia respectively. It is visible from
the word clouds that, apart from the common words “financial,”
“management,” “business” and “accounting,” location words like
“China,” “India” and “Malaysia” are also the most frequent terms.
The tf-idf weighting did not strongly down-weight those terms, as
the terms typically appear in only those resumes which belong to
the candidates from that particular country (and similarly for the job
ads). Such differences in language patterns between demographics
could explain a substantial fraction of the disparity.

5 METHODOLOGY
The above results strongly suggest that systematic differences in
word usage between demographic groups can substantially con-
tribute to disparate behavior in job-resume matching methods such
as tf-idf-based document retrieval. This phenomenon is consistent
with studies on the impact of sociolinguistic bias in human hir-
ing decisions [ 6]. Accordingly, we proposed and evaluated various
approaches for fairly matching resumes to job descriptions, by mit-
igating bias due to sociolinguistic behavior. Our overall approach
is to modify tf-idf to correct for demographic bias in word usage.
5.1 Fair-tf-idf
We propose a new method called fair-tf-idf, where we re-weight the
previously calculated tf-idf values with an extra fairness term to
make the word features fair for all demographics. Analogously to
the𝑝% Fairness Measure (Equation 1), we perform the re-weighting
of the tf-idf values in a manner inspired by the legal criterion for
discrimination, the 𝑝-% rule [ 7]. We calculate a fairness term for

each term𝑡, which we call the ‘p-ratio(𝑡)’. For each term, the ‘p-
ratio(𝑡)’is calculated as:
𝑝-𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜(𝑡)=𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1)
𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2), (2)
where𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1is the demographic with the lowest 𝑃(𝑡|
𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐)and𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2is the demographic with the high-
est𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐). To calculate the fairness weight, we first
calculate𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐), where𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐)repre-
sents the probability that a word toccurs in documents which
come from one demographic group. For example, if a word oc-
curs in 20 out 45 documents, where all the 45 documents are from
a same demographic group (country of origin in this case), then
𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐)is20
45.
We then obtain the ‘fair-tf-idf’ by multiplying the tf-idf value
of every term 𝑡by its ‘p-ratio’ :
fair-tf-idf(𝑡)=tf(𝑡)×𝑝-ratio(𝑡).
The p-ratio( 𝑡) is always between 0 and 1. The effect of fair-tf-idf
essentially is that, if a word occurs equally in resumes from all the
3 demographics, then the values 𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1)and𝑃(𝑡|
𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2)would be same, and the fair-tf-idf value will be
equal to its tf-idf. For those words which never occur in one of the
demographics, however, the value of fair-tf-idf becomes zero.
The tf-idf vectors are thus converted into a reweighted “fair-tf-
idf”vectors for all the 135 resumes and job postings. We normalize
the tf-idf vectors to unit length and use the cosine similarity with a
given job posting to rank the resumes, then select, e.g., the top-5
resumes.
5.2 Fair-tf-idf with Sigmoid Transformation
Although intuitive, the direct use of fair-tf-idf, as described above,
has a few limitations. Fair-tf-idf negated the effect of the idf weight-
ing for certain stopwords, giving them more weight again (see
experiments below). This is because fair-tf-idf increased the rela-
tive weights of words that are common among all the demograph-
ics, which typically includes stopwords. A second concern is that
the method does not provide users with the ability to control the
Figure 5: The Effect of the Sigmoid Transformation on the
𝑝-ratio.
fairness/fidelity trade-off. To address both of these concerns, we
further propose an enhanced method in which the p-ratio ’s are
passed through a sigmoid transformation before multiplying them
with the tf-idf:
fair-tf-idf(𝑡)=tf(𝑡)×idf(𝑡)×transformation(𝑝-ratio(𝑡)), where
𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑝-ratio(𝑡))=𝜎(𝜆(𝑝-ratio(𝑡)−𝜏)) (3)
and𝜎is the sigmoid function,
𝜎=1
1+𝑒−𝑥. (4)
The𝜏in the above transformation function is a translation param-
eter which roughly determines the cut-off point in terms of the
p-ratio to keep the tf-idf unchanged, i.e. it encodes a degree of
tolerance in the demographic differences of the terms (see Figure
5). The value of 𝜏should generally be set between 0 and 1. The
hyperparameter 𝜆>0is a scaling parameter which determines
how sharply the weights drop off. The effect of this transforma-
tion is roughly that, for 𝜆≥50or so, the terms whose p-ratio is
at least around 𝜏are kept with approximately their original tf-idf
weight, and the remaining “unfair” words below the cut-off point
are sharply discounted. This keeps the relative weight of stop words
and other relatively “fair” words unaffected, which helps to solve
the stop-words issue.
5.3 Term Frequency (TF) Baseline
Tf-idf was introduced as an enhancement in information retrieval by
adding a term weighting system along with term frequency (tf) to
de-emphasize common words [ 10]. But in our case, for matching re-
sumes to job postings, we suspected that tf-idf might down-weight
the keywords such as educational degrees or skills. We therefore
also considered a simple term frequency method as a baseline. The
tf baseline is performed analogously to the other methods, using
cosine similarity for ranking the resumes.

5.4 Fair TF Baseline
For completeness, we consider a baseline where we multiply the
term frequency with our 𝑝-ratio(𝑡) term:
fair-tf(𝑡)=tf(𝑡)×𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1)
𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2),
where𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 1is the demographic with the lowest 𝑃(𝑡|
𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐)and𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐 2is the demographic with the high-
est𝑃(𝑡|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐).
5.5 Limiting Number of Resumes (LNR)
Baseline
In this baseline method, limiting the number of resumes (LNR), we
used simple tf-idf terms, but fixed the number of resumes that can
be matched from each demographic with the given job posting to
be proportional to the number of applicants from that demographic,
to ensure parity. As the proportions of resumes that are matched
from each demographic, 𝑃(𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ|𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑐), are equal, the
results are always fair in the sense that the 𝑝%Fairness Measure is
1, which is the optimal value.
The major drawback with this method, however, is that we need
to have demographic labels for every resume at test time while match-
ing the resumes with job postings. Since this demographic infor-
mation is legally protected in many contexts, it may be difficult
to obtain for test users. In contrast, our approach only needs de-
mographic labels for the training data, which are often easier to
obtain. The parity constraint can also be very harmful to the ac-
curacy of the matching when there are demographic skews in the
qualified candidates per individual positions, as we will see in our
experiments below.6 EVALUATION
We evaluated all five methods based on both accuracy and the𝑝%
Fairness Measure, using all 135 resumes and 9 job postings. We
also reported 𝑡-SNE plots showing the position of resumes and job
postings in two-dimensional space after performing de-biasing.
6.1 p% Fairness Measure
Table 2 compares the percentage of total resumes from each de-
mographic that were selected as a match to all the 9 job postings
for each of the methods. We observe that the results are relatively
fair with the fair-tf-idf and fair-tf-idf with Sigmoid Transformation
methods. The Sigmoid Transformation method has two hyperpa-
rameters which affect the results. For Table 2, we used default
untuned hyperparameter values, 𝜆=50and𝜏=0.6, which leaves
the tf-idf weights of words with 𝑝-ratio(𝑡)>0.6relatively undis-
turbed, while setting the rest to approximately 0 (see Figure 5). We
study the impact of these hyperparameters in the next section. Note
that the baseline method which limits the number of resumes (LNR)
always selects an equal proportion of the resumes per demographic.
This means that the Fairness Measure will always be 1, which is
the maximum value. Table 3 compares the 𝑝% Fairness Measures of
each of the demographic as well as the overall Fairness Measure.
The results show that the Fairness Measure value is best when
using fair-tf-idf with the Sigmoid Transformation method, except
for the LNR baseline.
6.2 Impact of Hyperparameters on Fairness
The fair tf-idf with Sigmoid Transformation method has two hyper-
parameters to set, 𝜆and𝜏. We performed experiments to study the

display how the 𝑝% Fairness Measure changes with the values of 𝜆
and𝜏.
The graphs plotted in the Figures 6 – 8 show that the 𝑝% Fairness
Measure changes drastically with the cut-off value 𝜏. The fairness
generally dips after around 𝜏=0.6, which is due to the top of the
“S” in the sigmoid curve being shifted past the maximum value of

𝑝-ratio(𝑡)=1.0, which results in a “J-shaped” weighting curve,
instead of an “S-shaped” curve. The 𝜆hyperparameter also signifi-
cantly impact the performance. Among the different 𝜆s we tested,
the peak fairness measure was achieved when 𝜆=35.
6.3 Accuracy
The accuracy is calculated by the percentage of correctly matched
resumes among the top N resumes selected by a system. We used
three annotators to determine resume matches. We provided an-
notators with anonymous resumes, where we masked the demo-
graphic information. They were asked to annotate a job-resume pair
as a match if the required education and/or experience correctly
matches the job description. A candidate was considered a match
even if he or she was overqualified for the job. We disregarded
language requirements in the annotations. Annotators were asked
to annotate all the other cases as “no-match.” We used a major-
ity vote by the annotators to determine the final label and used
this in system evaluation. We calculated average inter-annotator
agreement and got the average Kappa value of 0.55.
Our aim is to make selection of resumes fair for each demo-
graphic without losing much of the accuracy.
Table 4 compares the total accuracy of each method along with
per-demographic accuracy. It can be observed from Table 4 that the
baseline which limits the number of resumes from each nationality
(LNR) has an accuracy rate of 76.66% overall, substantially lower

than the original TF-IDF method. This method has a perfect 1 𝑝%
Fairness Measure. However, the LNR method needs nationality la-
bels for each resume during testing and predicting time so that the
equal proportion of resumes can be selected. Having labels for na-
tionality is not always practical in many contexts, since applicants
may not be willing to provide this sensitive information.
The accuracy for fair-tf-idf with Sigmoid Transformation, at
86.66%, was the best of the fair algorithms, while simultaneously
achieving excellent fairness compared to the baselines other than
LNR. The total accuracy values for all the other fair baseline meth-
ods lie between 73% and 77%.
6.4 Visualization
We also created some visualizations to demonstrate how our pro-
posed de-biasing methods were effective in selecting the resumes
fairly. The𝑡-SNE plots in Figures 9– 11 represent all the resumes
plotted in 2-dimensional space using three of the methods men-
tioned in the previous section. For clarity and ease of compari-
son, only one job description has been plotted along with the 135
resumes. The plots illustrate the matching behavior due to any
demographic clustering behavior in the resumes, and similarities
between the job posting and the resumes.
In the plot for TF method (Figure 9), it can be seen that most
of the Malaysian and Indian resumes are close to the job posting.
So, when resumes were selected using cosine similarity it picked
most of the Malaysian and Indian resumes. In contrast, the Chinese
resumes are further away from the job posting. Most of the resumes
are also clustered according to their demographics, which is likely
to cause disparity in the matching.
Figures 10 and 11 represent the 𝑡-SNE plots of all the resumes
and the same job posting after applying fair-tf-idf and fair-tf-idf

mation Method.
with the Sigmoid Transformation respectively. After applying these
techniques, it can be observed that the job posting is close to sev-
eral resumes from each demographic. It can also be observed that
resumes with the same country of origin are no longer strongly clus-
tered into different regions, but have substantial overlap. This was

especially the case when applying fair-tf-idf with the Sigmoid Trans-
formation, making improved demographic parity in the matching
much more likely to occur.
6.5 Top Words
We also compared the 10 top words from each demographic before
and after applying fair-tf-idf with the Sigmoid Transformation in
Table 5. The main differences are that the words “China” and “Kong”
(as in “Hong Kong"), common words in Chinese resumes, are no
longer top word after applying the de-biasing method. It seems
that our method down-weights nationality-specific proper nouns,
which can be a source of bias. In contrast, the word “credit”, which
was not present before de-biasing, was promoted to the top word
list after de-biasing. Other job-related keywords such as “financial, ”
“management,” and “business,” remain in the top word list. This is
important since these words are very relevant for matching.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have studied how socio-linguistic patterns can lead to demo-
graphic bias in text-based algorithms for matching resumes to job
postings, and we proposed several fair modifications to the tf-idf
matching method to correct for these issues. It can be seen from
our experimental results that our proposed fair-tf-idf with Sigmoid
Transformation method performs well in de-biasing the data and
selecting resumes fairly and accurately. The parity in the distri-
bution of selected resumes was improved compared to the results
when no de-biasing was performed, as quantified by the 𝑝% Fair-
ness Measure, with relatively little loss in accuracy compared to
traditional tf-idf matching.
Along with the fair matching of resumes to job postings, we
expect that this method can be extended to provide debiased career
recommendations to applicants. Thus the model is not only useful
for recruiters but also for the applicants.
We also believe this method can be generalized and used in
other contexts. For example, in addition to nationality, the same
method can be used to mitigate gender bias in text retrieval. In
fact, the proposed method can be used to improve the fairness
of a wide range of text processing applications where tf-idf text
representations are used.
The main limitation of this study was that only a small number
of resumes was collected due to the burden of data annotation. In
the future, we plan to collect and annotate a larger resume datasetto further validate our results. This will facilitate the development
and use of fair deep neural network models for matching job posts
and resumes.
