ABSTRACT 
The HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s fundamentally changed 
sexual practices of men who have sex with men (MSM) in 
the U.S., including increased usage of sexual health-related 
(SHR) language in personal advertisements . Analyzing 
online personal ads from Craigslist, we found a substantial 
increase in SHR language, from ~23% in 1988 to over 53% 
today, echoing continuing concern about rising HIV rates. 
We argue that SHR language in Craigslist ads can be used 
as a sensor to provide insight into HIV epidemiology as 
well as discourse among particular communities. We show 
a positive significant relationship between prevalence rate 
of HIV in an ad’s location and use of SHR language in that 
location. Analysis highlights the opportunity for SHR 
information found in Craigslist personal ads to serve as a 
data source for HIV prevention research. More broadly, we 
argue for mining large-scale user-generated content to 
inform HCI design of health and other systems, and explore 
use of such data to examine temporal changes in language 
to facilitate improved user-interface design.

INTRODUCTION 
When designing large-scale health systems, data giving 
insight into user practices and language choices can help 
HCI designers to inform choices in data structure and 
system features. Traditional data collection methods can be 
slow, expensive, and inaccurate, particularly when focusing 
on sensitive communities and practices. By exploring relationships between user-generated content and 
established data collection methods, we seek to augment 
existing practices and make data collection faster, cheaper, 
and possibly more accurate. 
“Public health surveillance is the continuous, systematic 
collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data 
needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of 
public health practice” [40 ]. Surveillance is frequently 
employed to provide early warning for public health 
emergencies, monitor health progress at the population 
level, and inform public health policy. However, public 
health professionals, in attempts to curtail HIV infection 
rates, have noted “an urgent need to address gaps in our 
ability to monitor changes in HIV, STDs, and sexual 
practices among MSM” [39:884] (MSM is short for men 
who have sex with men, an inclusive term used in public 
health literature). Conducting frequent population-based 
surveys along with facility-based surveillance, while 
effective [ 2,39], requires considerable time and resources, 
and often only reaches  more visible segments of the MSM 
community [2]. 
In this paper, we explore the potential of using publicly 
available personal ads as a proxy for HIV and STI (sexually 
transmitted infection) statistics to augment current 
collection methods and provide more comprehensive data. 
Since the advent of online personal ads in the 1990s, MSM 
have willingly shared SHR information on sites such as 
Craigslist to facilitate sexual contact. Such data is free, 
plentiful, and readily accessible to researchers. The 
accessibility, affordability, and anonymity of Internet 
personal ads [ 11] make the Internet an “ideal medium for 
sexual pursuits” [9:74], but also an ideal environment for 
mining user-generated content .  
As compared to survey-based research, online personal ads 
give researchers quick access to millions of anonymous ads, 
which contain information analogous to data found through 
surveys and surveillance [16,17]. Ads can be continuously 
and systematically collected, with only minimal costs such 
as computational time spent gathering data. Thus, online 
personal ads have the potential to make a substantial 
difference in HIV research and prevention efforts.

relationship to HIV prevalence to demonstrate an Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal

1615application of mining online, publicly available data for use 
in real-world contexts . First, through our analysis of 
252,786 MSM Craigslist ads, we identified SHR language 
currently used online. Second, through a comparison with 
print personal ads from the 1980s, we demonstrate an 
increase in the use of SHR language, signifying that even 
30 years after the beginning of the HIV/AIDS crisis, health 
concerns among MSM persist and can be measured 
empirically online. Finally, by comparing use of SHR 
language in 95 locations, we find that HIV prevalence rates 
and SHR language in Craigslist ads have a significant 
positive relationship. Taken together, these contributions 
demonstrate the potential for publically available online 
data to be used as a surveillance tool and provide 
description of one method to create such tools.  
We present this  work as an example of mining user-
generated online media content and using it as a sensor for 
secondary purposes. Large, publicly available online 
datasets are important sources of information for HCI 
researchers. To properly design large-scale health data 
systems, HCI research must be conducted on the 
information architecture of such data and its potential use as 
a sensor. Similar methods and techniques could be used in 
other domains ( e.g., urban or civic informatics). 
Additionally, our work highlights issues around the 
timescale of codifying large-scale data from online media, 
particularly given evolving language. 
Our research also addresses gaps in the study of sexuality 
within HCI, particularly the shortage of research dealing 
with sexual orientation and homosexuality [ 24]. Research 
on the intersections of technology and sexuality contributes 
to the development and growth of the field of HCI [1]. By 
studying the online dating practices of MSM, we address 
the dearth of sexuality research within HCI. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We 
first provide some background on HIV/AIDS and the use of 
personal ads by MSM, followed by a discussion of related 
research. We then describe the methods and results of our 
empirical work as conducted in three phases: developing a 
sexual health dictionary; determining presence of SHR 
language in Craigslist ads and comparing current metrics 
with those from the 1980s; and building and analyzing 
statistical models to explore the relationship between SHR 
language and HIV prevalence. We close with a discussion 
of HCI design implications and a summary of our findings. 
BACKGROUND 
HIV/AIDS 
In the early 1980s, many gay men contracted and died from 
a mysterious disease initially known as “gay cancer.” The 
disease was eventually identified as AIDS, caused by the 
virus HIV and commonly spread through sexual contact. 
The HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States has been a 
considerable public health problem that has historically and 
continues to disproportionately affect MSM [5]. As a result, HIV/AIDS has fundamentally changed sexual practices in 
the U.S., particularly among MSM [39] .  
Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), a 
treatment first distributed in the United States in 1996, has 
succeeded in controlling HIV infections and decreasing 
AIDS deaths [28]. However, research has shown that some 
MSM conflate HAART’s benefits with a reduction in the 
risk of unsafe sex with HIV-positive partners, which has 
been shown to lead to a higher tendency to engage in 
unprotected sex [13]. Thus, HIV infection rates, especially 
those of MSM, have continued to increase. 
MSM account ed for 63% of all new HIV cases in 2010, and 
make up 52% of all HIV cases in the United States [5]. 
Taking into account the fact that MSM only make up 2% of 
the U.S. population [5], these statistics are especially 
alarming. Particular MSM subgroups, such as those under 
the age of 24 and young African-Americans , experience 
even higher rates of HIV infection [5]. Considering these 
statistics, it is unsurprising that disclosure of HIV status and 
use of SHR language is part of courtship for MSM. 
Personal Advertisements and MSM 
Personal ads have historically been useful in facilitating 
exchange between interested people when dating 
preferences lie outside of traditional markets, such as MSM 
[10]. Multiple studies have found that MSM meet sexual 
partners online significantly more often than others 
[19,30,31]. Given the relative frequency with which MSM 
use the Internet for sexual communication and their 
disproportionate risk of contracting HIV, how can the 
online content generated by MSM be used as a sensor for 
public health efforts to reduce the spread of HIV? 
Contradictory research has argued that online personal ads 
can either help or hinder HIV prevention efforts. An 
increase in MSM sexual contact brought about by online 
personal ads may have had negative effects on disease 
control [7,18,27]. For example, those who met sex partners 
online were more at risk to contract HIV and other STIs 
than those who did not [ 27]. Likewise, the launching of 
Craigslist for a particular city was found to predict a n 
increase in contraction of both AIDS and syphilis in that 
city, and the number of MSM personal ads linked to a 
particular city was found to be a significant predictor for 
AIDS cases [7] . Additionally, Craigslist’s search function 
may enable risky behavior by allowing users to search for 
behaviors that they desire, such as “bareback” (sex without 
a condom), a functionality that would not be possible 
offline or in print personal ads [18]. 
On the other hand , online dating could support HIV 
prevention by allowing sexual partners to discuss HIV 
status and protection preferences prior to meeting [ 31,38]. 
Just as Craigslist allows for searching for risky behaviors 
[18], it could also facilitate searching for safe behaviors. 
However, relying solely on information that sexual partners 
provide online can increase risk if it eliminates further

1616discussion of safe sex practices, particularly if sexual 
partners are unsure or incorrect about their HIV status [ 37]. 
While this debate is ongoing, in this paper, we adopt a new 
approach. We focus on the information that can be gleaned 
through an analysis of personal ads rather than on the 
practices that surround them. We demonstrate that 
computational analysis of language in MSM Craigslist 
personal ads can provide one source of public health 
surveillance for MSM. The information found in these ads 
has potential to aid in HIV prevention strategies that, if 
successful, could mitigate the negative effects that 
Craigslist has arguably had on the spread of HIV and STIs.  
RELATED WORK 
This paper draws from and contributes to several bodies of 
literature that have explored health implications of personal 
ads by MSM. Although previous studies have examined the 
use of SHR language in MSM personal ads [14,18, 22] and 
others have argued that Craigslist ads can be used for public 
health surveillance and HIV/STI epidemiology research  
[16,17], we posited that further insight could be gained by 
joining these two research methods. W e thus build on 
previous research by combining linguistic analysis of 
personal ads with epidemiological analysis to understand 
how online MSM personal ads can be used as a sensor for 
public health surveillance .  
Several studies have examined the content of personal ads 
on Craigslist and how it relates to sexual health and risk of 
HIV and other STIs in MSM [8, 18,22,29,32]. Health-
related language has been found to be more prevalent in ads 
posted by HIV-positive MSM [22] , giving evidence of 
serosorting (“preferentially selecting sex partners with 
concordant HIV status and … using condoms with partners 
of discordant status” [4:2497]), a method shown to reduce 
risk of HIV transmission [4]. One risk indicator is the 
volume of ads posted by any individual MSM, which 
predicted more likeliness to engage in unsafe sexual 
practices [ 29], while the marital status of MSM can also 
correlate with perceived safe ty [8,32]. These studies show 
how content of personal ads correlates with the sexual risk 
behaviors of those posting and replying to these ads. 
One notable focus relevant here can be seen in 
epidemiological work on HIV and Craigslist. Several 
studies have found relationships between the content or 
volume of Craigslist ads and real world prevalence of HIV 
and other STIs, showing that online personal ads and 
Craigslist in particular are effective tools for HIV 
epidemiology research [7,16,17]. For example, Fries et al. 
computationally extracted HIV status information from 
millions of Craigslist ads and found a positive predictive 
relationship with HIV rates by location, demonstrating that 
HIV status information disclosed in Craigslist ads can be 
used as a proxy for HIV rates among MSM [17]. These 
rates can in turn be used in “understanding or anticipating 
STI outbreaks” [17:13]. In addition to HIV rates, Craigslist 
posters include information about many risk behaviors that allow for public health surveillance [16]. Similarly, 
Chiasson et al. argue that the Internet is an ideal place to 
conduct research on the sexual health of MSM [9].  
Personal ads have been used to study changes over time in 
the use of health-related language long before the advent of 
the Intern et. Sociologist Alan G. Davidson analyzed the 
percentage of personal advertisements that included health-
related language in each of four years: 1978, 1982, 1985, 
and 1988 [14]. He found a “significant increase in personal 
advertisements suggesting a concern with health” from 
1982 – 1985 [14:125], the time during which many gay 
men first learned about AIDS [26], and again from 1985 – 
1988, showing that the effects from the first time period 
persisted [14 ]. Davidson’s work highlights how the gay 
community responded to the outbreak of HIV/AIDS by 
changing the language that they used to describe themselves 
and their sexual and dating preferences [14].  
Personal ads can be “useful data sources for assessing the 
meanings people attach to their sexuality, as well as for 
assessing changes in these meanings over time” [ 14:136]. 
Although the format and medium for personal ads has 
shifted from newspapers to websites, the implications of 
their power to convey sexual representations and practices 
has persisted and grown along with their volume. Thus, 
Davidson’s work led us to address the research question of 
how sexual health discourse among MSM has changed over 
time and across mediums, both in content and volume 
The literature on Craigslist and HIV/STIs has shown that 
Craigslist ads can be used as a kind of sensor. W e 
demonstrate that when used to collect and analyze health 
data, this sensor can provide information about disease 
rates, risk of spreading disease, and particular communities 
who may be at risk of contracting disease. When used in a 
public health context, this information could have powerful 
effects on HIV prevention and provides a real world 
example of the kind of outcomes promised by publicly 
available “big data”. Our work leverages linguistic analysis 
of personal ads as a potential way to harness such data. 
DATA 
Our initial goal was to replicate Davidson’s 1991 study, to 
determine how time and platform affected use of SHR 
language in MSM personal ads. Davidson compared the use 
of SHR language in gay male personal ads published during 
1978, 1982, 1985, and 1988 in the Village Voice , a weekly 
New York City (NYC)-based newspaper [14] . Our goal 
framed choices in data analysis, which began with NYC for 
the sake of comparison with Davidson. 
Although methods of posting personal ads have changed in 
the last 25 years, we turned to Craigslist, a popular online 
classifieds website, as a modern equivalent of print personal 
ads. Like print personal ads, Craigslist posts are anonymous 
and stand-alone (as contrasted with profile-based online 
dating sites) and allow disclosure of sexual practices and 
health-related language. Differences between Village Voice

1617and Craigslist personal ads include message length, cost, 
and possibility of censorship. Village Voice  personal ads 
had no word limit per se, but authors were charged on a 
per-line basis, while Craigslist ads are free with no word 
limit. Although the Village Voice ’s censorship policies were 
not stated in the four 1978-1988 issues we accesse d, the 
paper “reserves the right to reject or edit any 
advertisement” [ 35]. In comparison, Craigslist does not 
reject, remove, or edit ads unless other users flag ads for 
removal, and does not restrict adult content [12 ].  
Our dataset comprises 252,786 personal ads posted to the 
“men seeking men” (m4m) subsection of Craigslist . 
Craigslist maintains a separate website for each of many 
cities and towns in the United States. Using a custom-built 
RSS scraper, we collected all m4m ads within a two-week 
period in August and September 2013 in 95 metropolitan 
statistical areas (MSAs) (see Table 1) . Locations were 
selected to correspond with location-specific statistics on 
HIV prevalence rates as reported by the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) in a 2011 report [6]. 
We excluded seven locations on the CDC’s list of MSAs 
because a corresponding Craigslist site did not exist. 
Craigslist sites were selected to best approximate the 
geographic area of each MSA. 
Our data collection methods captured each ad as it was first 
posted, meaning that our dataset includes ads that may have 
later been flagged by users and/or subsequently removed. In 
practice, ads are often removed when the poster wants no 
more responses; such ads are still relevant for analysis. 
Meanwhile, duplicate ads within a location were removed 
from our dataset prior to analysis. During manual coding of 
500 ads, we identified a 0.2% rate of irrelevant ads. 
There is a risk that people misrepresent their HIV status on 
Craigslist or may not be aware of it. However, at a 
population level, we are interested in capturing use of SHR 
language of any kind, not the specifics of any individual’s 
personal status and claims. While there are almost certainly inconsistencies in individual ads, in aggregate, the data are 
relatively accurate [17 ]. 
Though we cannot claim that our sample is representative 
of all MSM in the U.S., research has shown that more than 
85% of MSM find sexual partners online [3, 20]. 
Additionally, the existence of a relationship between HIV 
prevalence rates in CDC data and the use of SHR language 
in our data, along with previous literature that has found 
similar positive correlation [17], signals the appropriateness 
of using Craigslist as a source to study MSM sexual health. 
On average, large cities included more ads than small cities: 
the eight cities with populations over five million 
comprised 36.04% of total ads, and the 31 cities with 
populations over two million comprised 77.92% of total 
ads. A majority of ads (88.77%) included the poster’s age. 
Of those ads with age included, excluding ads with reported 
age 99 or <10, the mean age in NYC was 34.59 (SD = 9.40; 
range 18- 80), while the mean in the overall dataset was 
slightly older: 34.81 (SD = 10.24; range 10- 98).  
SEXUAL HEALTH DICTIONARY 
Methods 
To analyze the use of sexual-health related (SHR) content 
in personal ads, we first created a dictionary of SHR 
language. Davidson provided a dictionary of health-related 
language based on ads from 1978-1988 [14], but instead of 
adopting Davidson’s dictionary or analyzing the data using 
a pre-supposed list of words and terms, we used open-
coding techniques to find the SHR language that MSM used 
in our dataset [14] . This method allowed the discourse used 
by the MSM community in their personal ads to shape the 
dictionary [ 14]. Four coders, including two gay-identified 
men, were given a sample of Craigslist ads from the dataset, 
and were asked to independently determine SHR words or 
terms in each ad. 500 ads in total were coded, 125 by all 
four coders for inter-rate reliability. Use of multiple coders 
allowed us to detect SHR language that may not be familiar 
to or identified by one coder alone. Agreement levels were 
acceptable at 72% with a Fleiss’ Kappa of .708. Words or 
terms were added to the dictionary if one or more of the 
coders identified the term as SHR. Two additional terms 
were added to our dictionary even though our coders did 
not identify them. These terms, “seeding” (and its shorter 
form, “seed”) and “uninhibited” , were mentioned in 
previous similar studies [18, 32] and occurred in our full 
dataset, but not in the subset used for open-coding. 
Next, to facilitate more detailed analysis, w e divided our 
dictionary into 6 categories: disease, HIV (a sub-category 
of disease), protection, risk (a sub-category of protection), 
safety, and health. Table 2 shows our full dictionary as 
compared with Davidson’s dictionary [14]. 
We intentionally excluded drug related terms to focus the 
scope of our paper on sexual health, replicate Davidson’s 
methods, and compare current levels of SHR language to 
the 1980s. Terms that referenced drugs without explicitly Population

1618mentioning sex were not included in Davidson’s study and 
were subsequently omitted here. However, drug use and 
sexual health are often bound up with each other, and future 
research should examine drug use and its relationship to 
sexual health and HIV/AIDS among MSM. 
Results 
There are four important differences between our 2013 
SHR language dictionary and Davidson’s 1978-1988 
dictionary (Table 2) [14]. First, Davidson’s dictionary 
included a subset of terms related to monogamy and 
relationship exclusivity, while our dictionary does not [14] . 
In the 1980s, exclusivity was often motivated by HIV/STI 
prevention, which is no longer the case [ 23]. Davidson 
analyzed monogamy-related terms separately [14], allowing 
us to compare our findings to only his health-related terms. 
Second, in the disease category and HIV sub-category, the 
1978-1988 dictionary includes relatively few terms: “tested 
disease-free”, “HIV negative”, and “AIDS-free 
relationship.” In 2013 the corpus of disease language has 
both increased (now including words such as “bug”, 
“clean”, and “std”) and settled on shorter phrases and/or 
abbreviations to describe one’s own STI status and to 
convey a preference for a partner’s STI status: “ddf”, 
“HIV+” or “poz”, “HIV-” or “neg”. 
Third, in our 2013 Craigslist dictionary, we found the word 
“safe” primarily used in a list of words describing the poster 
or his desired partner ( e.g. “very discreet, safe, sane, clean, 
d&d free, you also”). While Davidson’s dictionary includes 
“safe”, it also appears as part of several longer phrases that use “safe” in a dating context: “interested in safe dating”, 
“safe-sex romance” [14]. Again, we see 2013 Craigslist ads 
using shorter phrases than the 1978-1988 dictionary. 
Finally, words describing protection or lack of protection 
occur regularly in our 2013 data, but not at all in the 1978-
1988 data [14]. This suggests that contemporary MSM are 
more likely to communicate about protection techniques 
and preferences in personal ads than 1980s MSM. 
In the 25 years since Davidson’s 1988 dataset was 
collected, MSM have standardized and abbreviated their 
SHR language, allowing for rapid and efficient 
communication. Surprisingly, even though physical and 
financial word count barriers have been eliminated in the 
Craigslist personal ad medium, our Craigslist SHR 
language dictionary includes shorter and more to-the-point 
terms than the print ad dictionary. This is likely a result of 
the fact that SHR information is now routinely 
communicated, demonstrated by the use of abbreviations. 
The differences between our dictionary and Davidson’s 
show how SHR language has evolved beyond a topic of 
discussion or an ideal, and into the world of person al stats – 
akin to height, age, and weight. 
Additionally, our analysis shows how personal ad text 
evolves over time, leaving open questions about adoption of 
language as indicated by the changes between Davidson’s 
dictionary and ours. Differences in SHR language between 
1980s personal ads and current Craigslist ads highlight the 
constant evolution of SHR language. 
SHR LANGUAGE IN PERSONAL ADS OVER TIME 
Methods 
The next step in our comparison to Davidson’s work was to 
detect the presence of SHR language across our larger 
dataset. We started our analysis with ads posted to NYC-
area Craigslist . The text of each ad was compared to the 
terms included in our dictionary, and each ad was assigned 
a single binary indicator for the presence of SHR language .  
In addition to the dictionary entries listed in Table 2, we 
also searched for variations in phrasing, punctuation, and 
spacing. For example, in addition to “disease free”, we also 
searched for “disease-free”, “no diseases”, “diseased free”, 
and “diseased-free”, all of which appeared in the data. A 
term such as “ddf” (an abbreviation for “drug and disease 
free”)  likewise was expanded to include “dd free”, “d&d 
free”, “d&df”, “d/df”, “dd/f”, etc. Other terms in our 
dictionary ( e.g. “clean”) had to be distinguished from 
longer terms ( e.g. “clean cut”) that were not part of our 
dictionary and would not result in an indication of SHR 
language. To reduce false positives in our risk category, 
negations of the SHR term we re detected and ignored or 
reassigned as necessary. For example, an ad including the 
phrase “no bareback” would be put in the protection 
category, but not the risk category. Sexual health -related language, Craigslist 2013

We began by comparing data from the NYC metro area 
with historical data. Use of SHR language increased 
substantially, from 22.99% to 53.50% from 1988 to 2013 
(see Table 3 and Figure 1) . In our full dataset, we see an 
even greater percentage of SHR language: 53.96%.   
The increase in usage of health-related language tha t 
Davidson observed in the 1980s and attributed to concern 
with and response to HIV/AIDS [14 ] has not only persisted 
but has continued to grow throughout the last 25 years. Use 
of SHR language, including disclosing HIV status and safe 
sex preferences, has become a standard in MSM personal 
ads, occurring in over half of the ads in our sample. 
Across our categories of SHR language, disease-related is 
the most common (48.34%) . Within that category , 30.53% 
of ads with disease-related content include mention of HIV . 
This provides evidence to support our argument that the 
increase in health-concern in MSM personal ads over the 
past 25 years is greatly motivated by disease prevention, 
HIV prevention in particular. 
Following disease, safety is the next most common 
category (12.85% of ads). Protection-related terms, 
including many connoting risky sexual practices, were less 
common (4.78%), however, ads that used language 
specifically associated with a preference for unsafe sexual 
activity occurred in 3.38% of ads. This is comparable to 
Grov’s finding that 3% of Craigslist MSM ads in 2009 
sought unprotected sex [ 18]. Although a relatively small 
percentage compared to our other categories, 3.38%  
corresponds to approximately 8,544 ads seeking risky sex 
encounters in only two weeks. In NYC alone, a smaller 
percentage of ads included risky SHR language (2.35%), 
but this still corresponds to 252 ads in two weeks .  
SHR LANGUAGE AND HIV PREVALENCE 
Methods 
To explore relationships between characteristics of MSM 
and their locations and use of SHR language in personal 
ads, we constructed seven multivariate logistic regression 
models (see Table 5). Dependent variables were binary 
indicators of the presence of SHR language overall in each of our six SHR language categories: disease, HIV, safety, 
protection, risk, and health. We used the author’s age, the 
ad’s word count , and the ad location’s HIV prevalence (rate 
per 10,000 population) [6], population [34], and population 
density [33] as regressors . Ads in which authors did not 
indicate an age, as well as those with a reported age of 99 or 
<10 were excluded from analysis (11.33% in total). 
Ads were placed into one of six age groups based on the 
poster’s age, as reported in Table 4. Because use of SHR 
language varies significantly among age groups, age is used 
as a categorical rather than a continuous variable. Great 
care was taken to construct age groups based on HIV/AIDS 
history. Those in the youngest two age groups (born after 
1986) represent those “too young to remember life before 
HAART” [21:176]. Further divisions were made based on 
stage of life during the 1980s, when most people learned of 
HIV/AIDS. Those 45 and over compose one group, as these 
men were likely sexually active during the 1980s. Another 
group includes men 21 and younger, who may exhibit 
higher risk behaviors than older men [ 25]. Each age group 
has a similar sample size, with the exception of the 
youngest age group, which includes substantially fewer 
people, but is still important to keep separate due to the 
potential differences in risk preference between this group 
and the others [36 ]. Age groups were used as dummy 
variables, with the oldest age group as reference value.

Across all regression models (1-7), the prevalence rate of 
HIV in the ad’s location was a significant positive predictor 
of use of SHR language, even after controlling for 
population, population density, word count, and age . 
Although the effect size is relatively small and the high 
significance level may be due to the very large sample size, 
our results show a meaningful effect. In model 1, for 
instance, an increase in HIV prevalence rate of 100 people 
per 100,000 population ( i.e. an increase of 0.1%) predicts 
an increase of 4% in SHR language. 
Though our results are correlational, the positive 
relationship between HIV prevalence and use of SHR 
language supports an extension of Davidson’s findings that 
the HIV/AIDS crisis may have triggered increased health-
concern in MSM personal ads [14]. In the previous section 
we showed that overall use of SHR language has increased 
substantially in the past 25 years. Here we see that the 
magnitude of this trend varies geographically, and may be 
motivated in part by HIV prevalence.  
Cities with larger populations are more likely to have 
higher incidence of SHR language in MSM Craigslist ads 
(see Table 5 and Figure 2) . In the regression models (1-7), 
population is a significant positive predictor of SHR 
language in all six categories and overall. The scatterplot 
(Figure 2) demonstrates this relationship and also allows us 
to see several outliers, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, 
which has the highest use of SHR language but only an 
average HIV prevalence rate. Boise, Idaho, similarly, has a 
very low prevalence of HIV but a high use of SHR 
language. Outliers in the opposite direction include Jackson, Mississippi and Wichita, Kansas, both of which 
have a relatively high prevalence of HIV and low use of 
SHR language. Outliers may signify the effectiveness of 
HIV prevention strategies in these locations. Identifying 
HIV/STI outreach and education approaches in locations 
such as Boise and the San Francisco Bay Area may be of 
use to outliers in the opposite direction (Jackson, Wichita) , 
where similar approaches may help with HIV prevention. 
Use of SHR language differs significantly across age 
groups, with men 21 and under using significantly less SHR

1621language in all categories (models 1-7) than men in the 
reference group. This may be a result of the fact that young 
MSM exhibit higher risk preferences, or do not remember 
life before HAART [ 25]. However, MSM under 21 also use 
significantly less SHR language demonstrating a preference 
for unsafe sexual behavior than other age groups (model 6).  
Overall (model 1), men aged 38 – 44 are the most likely to 
use SHR language, even more so than men who were adults 
during the beginning of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Perhaps these 
men, who were teenagers during the 1980s HIV/AIDS 
outbreak, came of age during a time when the importance 
of safe sex was especially emphasized. 
Models 3 and 5 show that men aged 32 – 37 are relatively 
highly likely to use terms in our HIV and Protection 
categories. This may be a result of the multitude and 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS outreach and awareness 
campaigns in the 1990s [ 15], when these men were 
teenagers, which may have instituted a higher awareness of 
HIV/AIDS and sexual safety. 
Interestingly, in our health category (model 7), age and use 
of SHR language have a positive relationship, meaning that 
as age increases, use of terms in this category (“health” or 
“healthy”) increases . “Health” is a term that was featured 
prominently in Davidson’s dictionary and in his paper, 
implying that use of the words “health” and “healthy” were 
important ways for MSM of the time to convey their 
HIV/STI status and preferences for safe sex [14]. Use of 
these words in this context has since tapered off in favor of 
standardized and abbreviated terms such as “ddf”. 
However, the results of the regression model (7) indicate 
that those MSM who were using the words “health” and 
“healthy” to convey HIV/STI status in the 1980s may still 
be using these terms, while younger MSM are not. 
Our analysis showing that an ad location’s HIV prevalence 
rate is a significant predictor for use of SHR language in 
that ad (models 1-7) led us to further question whether the 
relationship holds in the other direction , i.e. whether the use 
of SHR language in a location predicts HIV prevalence rate 
in that location. Table 6 shows the results of a linear 
regression model testing this hypothesis (model 8). Though this relationship is not as strongly significant as the former 
(models 1- 7), it is significant at the 10% level, even after 
adding control variables . The sample size is limited to the 
95 locations from the CDC’s dataset [6]. A similar model 
might show the same effect at a higher significance level if 
data were available from more locations , showing potential 
for the use of Craigslist ads for public health surveillance. 
LIMITATIONS 
There are several limitations to our analysis. First, the full 
dataset may include SHR terms that were not identified by 
our coders. Next, the circulation area of the Village Voice  
and the readership area of NYC Craigslist ads do not match 
exactly. Another limitation of comparing our dataset with 
Davidson’s is that while his includes only single gay men, 
excluding bisexual or heterosexual MSM and couples [14] , 
ours includes all MSM. Further research could examine the 
differences in SHR language between gay-identified and 
non-gay-identified MSM.  
Although we removed duplicate identical ads, our dataset 
does include some similar or nearly-duplicate ads, 
presumably posted by the same user during our data 
collection period. Were a single user to generate a 
substantial portion of the ads in a particular location, this 
may compromise our analysis. Other limitations include the 
possibility of foreign language or spam ads, which were 
minimal but were not excluded from our dataset. 
With large-scale computational linguistics techniques, some 
margin of error is to be expected. Comparing our 
computational coding to a human-coded random sample of 
100, we identified two non-SHR ads that the computer 
coded as false positives, and zero false negatives. Thus, we 
can assume a margin of error of approximately 2%. 
One important limitation is the inability of our search 
algorithm to evaluate the context of a term. For example, 
the word “clean” is often used in a SHR context. However, 
it can also be used to discuss hygiene, drug use, etc. While 
a human can usually identify whether “clean” is being used 
in a SHR context or not, this is not an easy task for a 
computer. In fact, the two false positives that were found 
when calculating our computational margin of error both 
were instances of “clean” being used in a non-SHR context. 
The margin of error helps to mitigate this limitation.  
DESIGN IMPLICATIONS 
This study argues for computational analysis of online 
media content as a research method to discover insights 
about user populations , which is useful for HCI designers in 
a variety of contexts. First, when designing large-scale 
health data systems, designers must be cognizant of the 
ways in which users represent their health conditions, 
preferences, and activities. Computational linguistic 
analysis of data sources such as Craigslist ads can inform 
the information architecture of such systems. Next, many 
HCI domains would benefit from mining user-generated 
content to answer questions about how users communicate  HIV Prevalence Rate (8)

1622and represent themselves. In this paper we present an 
example of this in a health context, but similar methods 
could be used in the areas of urban informatics (to inform 
the design of city-wide technologies), user experience (to 
inform the design of user interfaces), and many more.  
This work also highlights temporal issues surrounding the 
use of language in user interfaces. We have explored how 
SHR language used by MSM has evolved in the last quarter 
century. While dropdown menus for HIV status and safe 
sex preferences on online dating sites would make 
computational analysis easier, as well as supporting 
serosorting and negotiation of sexual safety before meeting 
[37,38], such solutions are perhaps too simple if they do not 
take into account the evolution of language. Analysis of the 
constantly changing nature of language over time opens up 
opportunities for natural language processing and machine 
learning techniques to identify new SHR terms as they 
emerge, an area for future research. We encourage HCI 
research to develop tools to detect evolving language for 
use in user-interface design. 
CONCLUSION 
In this work, we examined the potential for online personal 
ad content to serve as a sensor for real world health 
behavior. This kind of low-cost, efficient sensing can 
augment existi ng data collection methods. Additionally, 
data collected through these mechanisms can inform 
systems designers about the necessary information 
architecture for large-scale health systems as well as the 
potential for online health interventions. Concretely, w e 
analyzed sexual health-related language in a large sample of 
MSM Craigslist personal ads. We first built a dictionary of 
SHR terms, then calculated the proportion of ads with SHR 
content and demonstrated a rising use of SHR compared to 
print personal ads in the 1980s. We then built regression 
models to determine demographic and location-based 
characteristics that predict use of SHR language.    
Our SHR language dictionary allowed us to examine the 
differences between ways that MSM currently 
communicate health-concerns to practices directly 
following the HIV/AIDS epidemic . Despite the longer 
length of online personal ads, SHR language is more 
standardized and abbreviated when compared to language 
documented in the 1980s. At the same time, we found a 
substantial increase in the percentage of ads using SHR 
language, from 22.99% in 1988 to 53.50% in 2013. This 
suggests that health-concerned language has become a core 
attribute of MSM personal ad content. The largest category 
of SHR language was disease-related, including much HIV-
related language, and 3.38% of ads indicated preferences 
for unsafe sexual practices. 
Our statistical models (1- 7) identified that the prevalence 
rate of HIV in an ad ’s location was a significant predictor 
for use of SHR language. This suggests that the substantial 
increase in SHR language that occurred over the past 25 
years may have been motivated by concern with HIV. These results highlight the potential for Craigslist ads to be 
used as a way to quickly gather information about MSM 
sexual health and practices for public health surveillance 
purposes to assist in HIV prevention. Additionally, we 
found that young MSM, a group with higher preference for 
risky behavior [ 25], were less likely to use SHR language in 
their ads, and we identified several outlying locations with 
high HIV prevalence but low use of SHR language. A SHR 
language sensor could potentially help to identify 
communities such as these who may benefit from HIV 
education and outreach.  
By employing data science techniques to analyze SHR 
language in a large, publicly available dataset, this research 
demonstrates that SHR language on Craigslist can serve as 
a sort of sensor. This sensor provides insight not only into 
epidemiological public health data and sexual practices and 
discourse among particular communities, but into the 
potential for similar sensors to transform publicly available, 
online data into design implications.  Future research could 
consider ways to improve such a sensor, such as by 
computationally identifying more information about an ad’s 
author’s demographics and sexual practices, or could 
ascertain new applications for the sensor . Another future 
research direction could contrast use of SHR language 
among different communities on Craigslist, to identify 
differences in sexual practices, discourse, and 
representation of online identity. Finally, research could 
examine the use of SHR discourse, or lack thereof, in 
profile-based online dating sites and mobile apps such as 
Match.com and Grindr, and the implications of censorship 
of SHR language on disease control.
