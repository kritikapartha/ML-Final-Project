ABSTRACT 
Within computer science education, a growth mindset is 
encouraged. However, faculty development on the use of growth 
mindset in the classroom is rare and resources to support the use 
of a growth mindset are limited. A framework for a computer 
science growth mindset classroom, which includes faculty 
development, lesson plans, and vocabulary for use with students, 
has been developed. The objective is to determine if faculty 
development in growth mindset and active use of the growth 
mindset cues in the CS0 and CS1 classroom result in superior 
academic outcomes. Comparative study results are presented for 
two semesters of virtual classroom environments: one semester 
without Growth Mindset, and one semester with Growth Mindset. 
Female students demonstrated the most growth, as measured by 
academic grades, in CS0, and maintained that growth in CS1. 
Males demonstrated growth as well, with both males and females 
converging at the same high point of accomplishment at the end of 
CS1. Race and ethnicity gaps between students were reduced, 
improving academic equity.

A growth mindset encourages the development of intelligence, in 
contrast to a fixed mindset, which considers intelligence to be 
fixed and unable to be changed [1, 2]. A person with a growth 
mindset faces challenges in a positive way resulting in progressive 
achievements. Earlier work on the growth mindset is rooted in the 
belief that basic qualities are dynamic and changing. In learning 
environments, growth mindset can be encouraged through specific 
feedback and cues to students, emphasizing effort instead of 
accomplishment. Research has demonstrated that a growth 
mindset can raise the grades and engagement of underrepresented 
students [3, 4]. Innovations explored here support providing 
growth mindset training to computer science faculty and the use 
of growth mindset techniques and feedback methods in CS0 and 
CS1 computer science classrooms. Resources to support the use of 
a growth mindset in the computer science classroom are limited, 
and faculty development in the use of growth mindset in the 
classroom is rare. Prior work has focused on growth mindset in 
the K-12 classroom [5, 6], and materials support teacher-student 
daily classroom interaction. This research team developed faculty 
tools and practices that promote student development of a growth 
mindset approach to their CS0 and CS1 courses.   
2  Background 
2.1  Growth mindset in education 
Prior work on growth mindset in educational settings has 
identified the use of growth mindset to move students away from 
deficit thinking and towards strengths-based thinking [7-9]. 
Growth mindset is asset-based and is a method which may help 
students overcome identity threats that may impact academic 
performance [10, 11]. Approaches for implementing growth 
mindset in the classroom often focus on K-12 environments [5, 6]. 
One of the most detailed outlines of interventions for 
implementing growth mindset in the classroom [8] was prepared 
for teachers of students with disabilities, but does not provide 
information on a specific implementation, the grade levels of 
students for the interventions identified, or any results. We build 
on this literature and show student achievement comparisons 
across time and across instructors to build a case for the utility of 
the growth mindset model developed for CS. 
2.2  Growth mindset in computer science

field that can be learned may support student persistence in the

878field [12, 13]. Computer science educators have theorized how 
faculty may support students in shifting fixed mindsets to those of 
malleability [14-17], and the field suggests that metacognition and 
self-regulation, two practices of growth mindset learners, is vital 
to success in computer science [18]. Establishing a growth mindset 
is said to improve student academic outcomes [19, 20]. Studies of a 
“growth mindset pedagogy” exist in K-12 learning environments 
[21, 22] but few have studied how faculty convey messages of 
malleable intelligence through their teaching and assessment 
practices. 
2.2  Research study context 
The research study presented is the beginning of a longer, 
longitudinal examination of student support structures to 
encourage retention in the computer science major and 
persistence to degree completion. The context is a 4-year public 
urban research university. The university was designated as a 
Hispanic serving Institution (HSI) in the past 5 years, and the 
department where this research was conducted is more diverse 
than the university, with a student population that is 54% 
underrepresented in the profession, evenly split between Hispanic 
and Black students at 27% each. Many of the CS and IT majors are 
first-generation college students and arrive at the university with 
no prior experience or exposure to computer science 
programming.  
Beginning in Fall 2019, the department began research on the use 
of growth mindset methods in the CS0 and CS1 classrooms. The 
research was initiated with a talk in Spring 2020 by Jen Rosato 
from the College of St. Scholastica in Minnesota, who had 
successfully piloted a growth mindset program. A faculty reading 
group was initiated, using [5], and faculty received individual 
copies of the book, with the intention of meeting monthly to 
discuss possible classroom interventions. Meetings continued 
during Spring 2020, but discussion moved from in-person 
classroom teaching to virtual classroom teaching, and initial plans 
to use growth mindset methods and develop university growth 
mindset materials were superseded by the need to establish 
remote, virtual classroom instruction, as the university and 
surrounding community was very highly impacted by the 
pandemic and associated restrictions. 
During the summer of 2020, growth mindset discussions resumed, 
with the faculty working group becoming more focused, as they 
revised CS0 and CS1 curriculum and course materials, to ensure 
consistency with increasing undergraduate enrollment. Asset-
based pedagogy continued to be a priority, as students were 
perceived as more isolated due to the pandemic, potentially 
making a growth mindset even more important for long-term 
persistence and success. Over time, the faculty have been 
collaborating and moving growth mindset ideas into the classroom 
teaching philosophies, incorporating more growth mindset 
language into interactions with students, and deliberately shifting 
course design, including lecture materials, homework, and 
laboratory assignments, towards growth mindset pedagogies. 
Earlier work [23] outlined the six principles of growth mindset, 
adopted for computer science. These include identifying 
motivations for each topic in computer science, encouraging the process of mastery, praising effort, not ‘ability’, identifying and 
encouraging initiative, such as planning, and thinking ahead, 
encouraging persistent and multiple attempts, providing positive, constructive feedback, and avoiding the imposter syndrome.  
3  Approach 
3.1  Growth mindset categories 
First, the faculty distinguished between static and dynamic growth 
mindset. Under dynamic growth mindset, in the classroom, the 
timeline of the course is also necessary to keep track of. While 
there is a general guideline of encourage and guide students on 
their path to eventual success, there are timeline specific events 
such as evaluation of assignments, quizzes, and exams. Such 
events require time specific feedback: e.g., “you can catch up on 
what you’ve missed”, “just always be coding” - at the beginning of 
the course; “you are on the right track”, “moving in the right 
direction” - close to the middle of the semester; and “almost there”, 
“you just need to finish it” - before the finals. 
Growth mindset (GM) can also be categorized as group vs 
individual. While it is important to guide “all” in the right 
direction and make sure that faculty are spending time preparing 
all students to their main exams and quizzes starting in advance 
and then discuss the exam results and point to the weak side of 
overall performance in the section(s), faculty are able as well to 
embed growth mindset into feedback for every single student. 
There might be a need to talk in person or send additional emails 
regarding those outlining exam results in both lower and upper 
margins. 
Another gradation which can be used while talking about GM 
categories is general vs specific/detailed GM. When giving 
feedback on a student’s assignment or grading an exam, details 
really matter. The students should feel that faculty care and do 
read student explanations and understand student thoughts. This 
can be demonstrated by faculty addressing specific details of the 
work and potential mistakes or praise the good work in detail. 
The faculty, as educators, had as a goal to combine all these GM 
techniques and implement them simultaneously, making GM an 
inseparable part of the courses. This integration of growth mindset 
becomes the way an instructor thinks and evaluates student work, 
within the tight timeframe of an individual class.  
3.2  Research questions 
The faculty designed a comparative study, based on Fall 2020 
(FA20) and Spring 2021 (SP21) virtual (remote) classroom data. 
Both semesters were taught synchronously due to covid-19, for the 
full 16-week semester, using Blackboard as the learning 
management system (LMS). The course experience was consistent, 
in that the same virtual environment, CS0 or CS1 syllabus, remote 
office hours, and remote learning support were available. The 
research questions were:  
RQ1: “Do explicit quotes and statements added to labs and 
assignments about growth mindset influence student achievement, 
as measured by course grades in CS0 and CS1?”  
Virtual Session: Interventions
 
SIGCSE ’22, March 3–5, 2022, Providence RI, USA
879RQ2: “Do these quotes and statements influence student 
achievement differentially (e.g., impact women more than men)?” 
 FA20 instruction was conducted without growth mindset 
interventions. The research study was refined in late 2020 and the 
faculty used growth mindset interventions in SP21.  
4  Growth Mindset in the Classroom 
4.1  Growth Mindset Materials 
Of the 5 faculty teaching 7 sections of CS0 and 4 faculty teaching 5 
sections of CS1, 2 faculty from CS0 and 2 faculty from CS1 used 
the growth mindset interventions in the timeframe specified for 
the study. The participating faculty either had been part of the 
faculty working group, initially started in 2019, or were closely 
associated with the working group, participating in discussions, 
and sharing and contributing teaching materials to the growth 
mindset repository the faculty was building for CS0 and CS1.  
 Pedagogical change on the assignments were very specific and 
clear, as shown in Figure 1. The approach of displaying growth 
mindset inspirational quotes on bulletin board or in the classrooms 
are good examples of visually displaying them [8]. The faculty 
realized that inspirational quotes embedded in labs and 
assignments that are visually recognizable would promote growth 
mindset. Thus, the research team collected inspirational quotes 
that presented growth mindset ideas and added them to all the labs 
and assignments. Table 1 provides a selection of the inspirational 
quotes used as a header on all the pages for the labs and 
assignments as shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1. Examples of inspirational quotes used in CS0/1 
labs 
The inspirational quotes are grouped by theme. Based on the 
timeline and type of lab and assignments, the inspirational quotes 
are carefully selected. For example, quotes from the “Don’t Give 
Up” theme are used towards the end of the semester, with quotes 
from the “On Failure” theme being used for complicated 
labs/assignments, and quotes from the “Computer Science Quotes” 
theme is used in the middle of the semester, and so on. 
4.2  Growth Mindset in the Classroom 
4.2.1 Participants. The research study was managed under an 
approved IRB protocol. Undergraduates enrolled in CS0 and CS1 
for FA20 and SP21 participated in the research. During FA20, all CS0 and CS1 sections were taught as usual. During SP21, the 
faculty members who were participating in the growth mindset 
community of practice used their updated labs, assignments, 
lectures, verbal cues, and feedback to students in the virtual 
classroom. All students enrolled in the sections with the growth 
mindset faculty participated. Students in classes with faculty who 
were not participating in the growth mindset community of 
practice did not receive the growth mindset interventions. Their 
class was taught in the usual manner, as it had been during FA20.

4.2.2 Procedure. The faculty community of practice had discussed 
the types of common errors for each CS concept introduced in CS0 
and CS1. Numerous areas were identified, including weak 
foundations in algebra and logic, confusion about variable scopes, 
logical operations, loops and stop conditions, array and index 
values, nested if-else and nested loops. 
Next, the faculty discussed how they could collectively address 
these common problem spots and errors. The consensus was that 
for the GM faculty, errors, and problems which the students might 
encounter would be discussed at the time an assignment or lab 
was given, to normalize the expected error(s), and to discuss how 
students could respond.  
Faculty discussed how praise can shape students’ mindsets, the 
difference between process praise and person praise, and, how to 
shift praise to highlight the process. Examples of process praise 
were shared during the community of practice meetings, with 
discussions of where the comments could be used. The faculty goal 
was to avoid praising things that are typically considered stable 
such as talent or intelligence. The faculty wanted to encourage the 
development of students with a growth mindset, embracing 
problems as an opportunity to learn in contrast to students who 
assume that their intelligence is set, are more likely to seek to 
demonstrate their “smartness” and less likely to ask questions to 
overcome setbacks in their learning. Understanding this, the 
faculty realized, that whether a student has a growth or fixed 
mindset has a direct impact on how he or she faces academic 
challenges. A student with a growth mindset will accept 
challenges and persevere in order to succeed. This student will

880face learning and challenges with an “I have not mastered this 
‘yet’” attitude, implying that they will master the concept in the 
future. 
4.2.3 Interventions . The growth mindset (GM) classes were very 
similar to the non-GM courses. Courses began in the usual way at 
the start of the semester, and the GM interventions were restricted 
to assignments, lectures, and verbal cues and feedback to students. 
Within the GM courses, each programming assignment given to 
students now had a GM quote as a header at the top of the page, 
offset by color and attributed to the speaker. Laboratory 
assignments also included motivating quotes in the header on each 
page. During lectures, one or two slides were used to initially to 
include a motivating quotation, which was briefly read and 
discussed with the class, before moving on to the standard lecture 
materials.  
The most striking intervention was with the growth mindset 
faculty changing their behavior when providing verbal cues and 
direct feedback to students. For example, rather than stating that a 
solution was ‘wrong’, faculty would state that the student had ‘not 
yet’ solved the problem. Common shared errors were discussed, 
and classes discussed solutions together, reducing the potential for 
individual isolation and discouragement.  
5  Data Gathering and Evaluation 
5.1  Data Collection 
In this study, the lab and assignment scores were collected for CS0 
and CS1 courses for FA20 and SP21. For FA20, CS0 had a total of 7 
sections with 130 students, CS1 had a total of 6 sections with 103 
students. For SP21, CS0 had a total of 7 sections with 114 students, 
CS1 had a total of 5 sections and 98 students. In summary, a total 
of 233 students for FA20 and a total of 212 students for SP21.  
In particular, the GM faculty that taught CS0 and CS1 in FA20 
with no growth mindset interventions were a total of 3 and 5 
sections, respectively, consisting of a total of 143 students (Table 
2). The same GM faculty that taught CS0 and CS1 in SP21 with 
growth mindset interventions were a total of 3 sections each 
consisting of a total of 104 students. The remaining details of the 
number of male/female students, ethnicity, and race information is 
shown in Table 2.  
Gender is categorized as Male and Female; Ethnicity as Not 
Hispanic or Latino (NHS) and Hispanic or Latino (HIS); Race as 
White or European American (WH), Black or African American 
(BA), Asian American (AS), American Indian or Alaska Native 
(IA), and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (HP), which 
are based on the Census Bureau classification. 
Two GM faculty taught CS0 for both semesters with the same 
material and rubrics consisting of 20 labs and 7 assignments. The 
same process was used with CS1 for both semesters consisting of 7 
assignment and 7 labs. For CS0, GM_Faculty_A taught one section 
and GM_Faculty_B taught two sections for both semesters. For CS1, GM_Faculty_C taught one section for both semesters and 
GM_Faculty_D taught four sections in FA20 and two sections in 
SP21.

5.2  Data Analysis Methods 
Data was gathered after the conclusion of Fall and Spring 
semesters. Lab and homework assignments, and final grades were 
all used for the analysis. The CS0 and CS1 data score from the GM 
faculty’s sections (Table 2) were merged and classified into two 
groups, FA20 (non-GM) and SP21 (GM). The data was further 
separated by gender, ethnicity, and race for the statistical analysis.

(FA20) and GM (SP21) 
6  Results 
6.1  RQ1: GM Impact on Learning Outcomes 
6.1.1. Labs and Assignments . Overall, students in the growth 
mindset semester (SP21) performed better on both the labs and 
assignments with an overall average increase of 12% in CS0 and 
8.5% in CS1 as shown in Figure 2. Here on after, both labs and 
assignments data scores for CS0 and CS1 were combined (i.e. 
CS0/1) and classified as FA20 (non-GM) and SP21 (GM).

SIGCSE ’22, March 3–5, 2022, Providence RI, USA
8816.1.2. Mean Grades . From FA20 to SP21, CS0/1 students in the 
target classrooms shifted mean grades from 67.5 to 74.3 on a 100-
point grade scale (Figure 3), with the pattern holding for both 
courses. These differences were compared using independent 
sample t-tests to understand whether the differences could be due 
to chance, or whether this null hypothesis should be rejected. The 
students who received the growth mindset intervention ( µ = 74.4, 
sd = 27.7) compared to the students who did not receive the 
intervention ( µ = 67.5, sd = 39.4) demonstrated significantly better 
grades t(460) = -2.63, p = .004. 
6.2  RQ2: GM Impact by Demographics 
6.2.1. Gender . When compared as sub populations, both men and 
women improved their average scores in the growth mindset 
condition. Specifically, men raised their mean score from 66.1 to 
73.4 (Figure 3). The growth mindset condition led to better grades 
for men ( µ = 73.5, sd = 27.4) than the control condition ( µ = 66.1, 
sd = 28.7) and this difference was statistically significant t(357) = -
2.55, p = .006. Women also improved in the growth mindset 
condition from a mean of 72.9 to 77.4, yet the lower number of 
women in the dataset led to lack of power to detect the difference 
as statistically significant for them as a subgroup t(99) = -0.75, p = 
.229. 
6.2.2. Ethnicity : An unanticipated outcome was found with 
ethnicity, as the GM interventions had been designed for all 
students and did not target any community of students. Mean 
scores for Hispanic students appeared to increase at a greater rate 
than for non-Hispanic students, yet both subgroups increased their 
achievement markedly. Hispanic students who received the 
growth mindset intervention shifted nearly 10 points in final 
grades, with SP21 students earning mean score of 75.6 (sd = 25.1) 
and FA20 students earning lower scores ( µ = 65.6, sd = 29.8) t(119) 
= -2.21, p = .014). Non-Hispanic students in the growth mindset 
condition ( µ = 73.9, sd = 28.6) outperformed non-Hispanic students 
in the control condition ( µ = 68.6, sd = 29.2 ) t(330) = -1.70, p = 
.046) 
6.2.3. Race : Other subgroups were compared from Fall to Spring, 
with the growth mindset intervention occurring in SP21. Black 
students improved their average grades 10 points from control condition ( µ = 61.6, sd = 29.7) to growth mindset condition ( µ = 
71.5 , sd = 28.1), t(175) = -2.35, p = .01. Asian students remained 
relatively steady with a 2-point shift, and white students improved 
their scores by approximately 7 points from control condition ( µ = 
70.9, sd = 27.5) to growth mindset condition ( µ = 77.2, sd = 26.5), 
t(182) = -1.65, p = .049. The changes for Asian students were not 
statistically different.  
A threat to validity of an academic achievement study could be the 
effect of time on grade results—meaning the specific semester 
itself (Spring semester, at the year mark of a global pandemic) may 
lead to increased achievement rather than the course 
implementation of a new initiative. The previous data comparison 
kept the instructor constant and compared across time. This 
analysis compares across instructors but holds the time period 
constant.  
6.3  GM Impact by GM and non-GM faculty 
The final letter grade earned in the course were converted to the 
4.0 GPA scale. This was done because while the instructors who 
were a part of the study were sharing final numeric percentages, 
for the faculty who were not including growth mindset pedagogies 
only final letter grades were available. 
 
Figure 4. Average GPA (4.0 scale) for non-GM instructors 
and GM instructors 
Figure 4 shows differences in average grades for each of the two 
courses. For CS0, the average GPA was 2.38 (C+) for non-GM

882classes and 3.18 (B) for GM classes. For CS1, the average GPA was 
2.66 (C+) for non-GM classes and 2.97 (B-) for GM classes. An 
independent samples t-test was used to see if the groups differed 
statistically from one another in the Spring of 2021 only, in other 
words, whether students in the growth mindset courses did 
significantly better than the students enrolled in the same courses 
at the same time with no growth mindset pedagogies. Students in 
the GM condition ( µ = 3.03, sd = 1.27) outperformed their non-GM 
peers in SP21 ( µ = 2.75, sd = 1.24) by nearly a letter grade, and this 
difference was statistically significant t(210) = -3.11, p = .001. 
6.4  Student-reported Impact 
The impact of the use of the growth mindset materials on students 
was also assessed through a 5-question Likert scale survey, 
administered to the students in the growth mindset sections at the 
end of the semester. A total of 69 students responded to the 
survey, with CS0 ( n = 30) and CS1 ( n = 39), as seen in Figure 5. 
Overall students noticed the statements and most said they 
supported their learning, kept attitude positive. 
 
Figure 5. Student responses ( n = 69) to the use of GM  
 
Students in the growth mindset condition were asked to describe 
their experience of the growth mindset phrases that were added to 
assignments and labs, and sixty-nine students completed the 
survey. First, more than two thirds agreed they noticed the 
phrases and they were well visualized (71%) while slightly fewer 
said the phrases helped them work hard through difficult 
situations (61%).  
 
Table 3. Comments from students in CS0/CS1 GM sections 
Love the comments. They are very motivating.  I enjoyed seeing them on the homework and labs. I liked reading the different quotes 
every time.  
I love it! I hope this continues because it motivates the student to face new challenges.  
I like those phrases; it helps me not to give up when I have problems with the labs  
When I get nervous about an assignment, I always think that I’m just learning and 
will grow to know it.  
I think that it should be more visible and by people that are well known by students.  
 
More than half agreed that the phrases motivated/engaged their 
learning in class (59%) and more than half read all of the phrases 
on their labs and assignments (59%). More than half stated the 
growth mindset phrases encouraged them to complete 
assignments to a greater degree than other courses (56%). 
 
 A full dataset, with comparison of the letter grades awarded, t-test 
results, and charts, showed that all students did better when the 
growth mindset statements were added to the classroom. This 
study was conducted with virtual classrooms, and the research 
team is currently working to see if this continues to hold true as 
face-to-face classroom interaction resumes. Table 4 summarizes 
the aforementioned statistical results.

7  Conclusion and Future work 
The results demonstrate that, in a virtual environment, the 
implementation of growth mindset motivation quotes, verbal cues 
and feedback to students is easy to do and can make a detectable 
difference. Faculty discussed common pitfalls with the class, 
identifying them as expected and making sure students had 
strategies to detect and overcome challenges. Faculty focused on 
individual and overall class improvement. The sample size for this 
research was small, given the one-year timeframe of the study and 
the smaller class size of 20-25 which the department maintains for 
improved learning. The research team will continue to gather data 
to understand if a larger study, with greater numbers, shows 
similar results. In addition, the team will begin to make more 
complex statistical analyses of the data as numbers increase and 
intersectional groups (Latinas, black men) reach large enough 
numbers for statistical analyses to be meaningful. This academic 
study is unique in that the diverse population allows for 
marginalized groups to reach critical mass for statistical study. 
This is part of an ongoing effort towards growth mindset teaching, 
and it is a promising finding that faculty who have been 
developing the growth mindset framework in computer science 
teaching and learning for multiple semesters saw an increased 
bump in achievement with the addition of explicit quotes and 
statements. 
The research study presented in this paper has also developed an 
initial set of faculty interview codes that denote fixed and growth 
mindset beliefs of educators in computer science. Future work will 
include an external evaluator who will add observations of lessons 
and host focus groups with students to better understand how the 
ideas of incremental intelligence are evident (or not evident). 
Triangulating these sources could provide new information 
regarding how instructional practices that emphasize effort may 
influence student learning.
