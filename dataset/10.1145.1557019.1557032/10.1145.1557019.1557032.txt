ABSTRACT
The problem of ethnicity identiﬁcation from names has a
variety of important applications, including biomedical re-search, demographic studies, and marketing. Here we re-
port on the development of an ethnicity classiﬁer where
all training data is extracted from public, non-conﬁdential
(and hence somewhat unreliable) sources. Our classiﬁer uses
hidden Markov models (HMMs) and decision trees to clas-sify names into 13 cultural/ethnic groups with individual
group accuracy comparable accuracy to earlier binary (e.g.,
Spanish/non-Spanish) classiﬁers. We have applied this clas-
siﬁer to over 20 million names from a large-scale news cor-pus, identifying interesting temporal and spatial trends onthe representation of particular cultural/ethnic groups.

Here we describe our classiﬁer for deducing the likely cul-
tural/ethnic origins of arbitrary names. This work is part
of our eﬀort to develop the Lydia news/blog analysis sys-
tem [14] into a resource for the social and political sci-
ence research. Interactions between distinct ethnic/cultural
groups comprise one of the dominant social forces shaping
our world. Accurately quantifying the nature of these in-teractions provides essential data for social science research,in ﬁelds as diverse as history, political science, and interna-tional relations.
In this paper, we describe the methods underlying our
Lydia name ethnicity classiﬁer, as well as interesting analy-
sis resulting from applying our classiﬁer to large-scale newsdata. Table 1 demonstrates how our classiﬁer deals appro-priately with the names of twenty world leaders. We are by
no means the ﬁrst to build such a classiﬁer; see our discus-
sion of prior work in Section 2.
We do not claim our classiﬁer is more accurate than others
described in the literature because direct comparisons couldnot be conducted. However, informal comparisons suggest
our 13 ethnicity classiﬁer is quite competitive with simple
binary (Spanish/non-Spanish) classiﬁers reported elsewhere.That said, we believe our classiﬁer is interesting primarilybecause of its dependence on open data sources, methods,
and because of our unique application to news analysis:
•Dependence on Open Data Sources – The most critical
step in developing any ethnic name classiﬁer is acquir-
ing a large gold standard of ethnically-classiﬁed names.This is more diﬃcult than it sounds. Racial/ethnicdata is widely collected by government, industry, and
other organizations, but sensitive personal data in such
records are kept conﬁdential. Signiﬁcant genealogicaland immigration records are typically made availableonly for small numbers of speciﬁc name queries, notlarge-scale downloading, and have issues with accuracy
and signiﬁcance.
We have worked around these diﬃculties by basing it
exclusively on data extracted from the open source en-cyclopedia Wikipedia [22]. Extracting reliable name-
ethnicity pairs from Wikipedia required solving a va-
riety of technical issues, but our methods generalize to

dreds of thousands of interesting groups deﬁned in
Wikipedia.
•Improved Classiﬁcation Methods – Despite the enor-
mity of Wikipedia, our extracted name-ethnicity pairs
provide us with between one-to-two orders of magni-
tude fewer names than enjoyed by state-of-the-art clas-
siﬁers. This mandates that we be more sophisticated
in our use of training data.
Our classiﬁer is based on a hierarchical decision tree
of hidden Markov models (HMMs). We make exten-
sive use of k-mer frequency analysis to compensate for
names not occurring within our corpus. We describe
our techniques in detail, and present experiment re-
sults supporting a variety of design decisions.
•Applications to News Analysis – To demonstrate the
signiﬁcance of our ethnicity classiﬁcation, we present
several intriguing results in applying it to news
streams, drawn from a large-scale study [23]. We un-
cover interesting trends in interactions between ethnic
groups, as well as the frequency and sentiment associ-
ated with diﬀerent groups in diﬀerent contexts.
•Research Availability of our Classiﬁer – We did not
set out initially to develop our own classiﬁer, but our
inability to gain suﬃcient access to commercial or even
research classiﬁers forced our hand. In response, we
are committed to maintain our ethnicity classiﬁcation
server ( http://www.textmap.org/ethnicity ) as an open
resource for all legitimate research applications.
Our paper is organized as follows. We discuss related
work in name ethnicity analysis in Section 2. Methods for
extracting reference data from Wikipedia are discussed in
Section 3. The HMM and decision tree techniques under-
lying our classiﬁer are presented in Section 4. Performance
results on the accuracy of our classiﬁer and the impact of
various design decisions is reported in Section 5. Interesting
applications of our analysis to large-scale news feeds follow
in Section 6. Finally, our conclusions and future work are
presented in Section 7.2. PREVIOUS WORK
The problem of ethnicity identiﬁcation from names has a
variety of signiﬁcant applications. Perhaps the most impor-
tant application is to biomedical research [6, 4, 7, 8, 20].
The notion of race or ethnicity can serve as a surrogate re-
ﬂecting the genetic or dietary diﬀerences among individuals.
Experimental design criteria may block direct requests for
ethnic-self identiﬁcation, or the need for such data may not
be realized until too late in the course of a study. Other ap-
plications include population demographic studies [12, 16],
including predicting overall identity status [1] and measur-
ing the eradication of discrimination [17]. Finally, there are
business applications in targeting product marketing eﬀorts
towards particular groups of individuals. Mateos [16] pro-
vides an excellent review of work in the ethnicity detection.
An important problem faced by any such classiﬁcation
program is identifying a meaningful taxonomy of linguistically-
distinct cultural/ethnic groups, a task requiring extensive
knowledge of history, linguistics, and demographics. Here
we have been most impressed by the work of Mateos, Web-
ber, and Longley [17], who propose a taxonomy into Cul-
tural, Ethnic and Linguistic (CEL) types. Their taxonomy
consists of 185 CEL types which are grouped into 15 broad
CEL groups. These groups correspond closely to the ethnic
groupings recognized by our classiﬁer.
Many previous eﬀorts in ethnicity classiﬁcation focuses on
distinguishing members of a single CEL group. Binary clas-
siﬁers can be very useful to particular domains. The Gener-
ally Useful Ethnicity Search System (GUESS) uses Spanish
names to determine Hispanic ethnicity [5]. Coldman, Braun,
and Gallagher perform binary classiﬁcation of names as ei-
ther Chinese or non-Chinese [6]. SANGRA ( South Asian
Names and Group Recognition Algorithm ) is one of several
programs to identify South Asians by names, which are an-
alyzed in [10, 11]. However, for the purposes of our analysis,
we require a multi-faceted classiﬁcation system, capable of
discriminating among a relatively large number of ethnic
groups. As noted by Mateos [16], this type of classiﬁcation
engine has seen relatively little attention.
The primary method used in ethnicity classiﬁcation is
comparison to known surname lists. Deriving accurate
50name lists for use in a classiﬁcation engine requires sub-
stantial eﬀorts, however. Lauderdale and Kestenbaum de-
scribe the development of surname lists for six Asian ethnic-
ity groups [12]. Coldman et al. [6] use a simple probabilistic
method based on full name lists which is somewhat simi-
lar to our system. This system could not, however, classify
names which did not appear in the input name lists. Fiscella
and Fremon [7] describe the combination of geocodal infor-
mation and surname analysis to predict the ethnicity. They
state that better results are achieved by combining both the
geocodal and surname information. In subsequent sections,
we will describe methods for the compilation of our name
lists, the classiﬁcation methods which utilize them, and the
accuracy of our resulting system.
3. EXTRACTING NAME LISTS FROM
WIKIPEDIA
Wikipedia is an open repository containing much of the
world’s general knowledge, which makes it an attractive fo-
cus for projects on information extraction. In this case,
we needed to extract fairly accurate lists of names labeled
by ethnicity, but more generally we would like to produce
lists of entities corresponding to members of any natural
group [19].
We sought to exploit Wikipedia’s extensive network of
categories under which articles are classiﬁed. For example,
basketball player “Steve Nash” is classiﬁed as member of the
following categories:
1974 births |Living people |Basketball players at the
2000 Summer Olympics |British Columbia sports-
people |Canada’s Walk of Fame |Canadian basket-
ball players |Canadian expatriate sportspeople in the
United States |Point guards |Dallas Mavericks play-
ers|Canadians of British descent |Members of the
Order of British Columbia |Oﬃcers of the Order of
Canada |Olympic basketball players of Canada |Peo-
ple from Victoria, British Columbia |People from Jo-
hannesburg |Canadians of Welsh descent |Phoenix
Suns players |Santa Clara Broncos men’s basketball
players |South African immigrants to Canada |Santa
Clara University alumni.
From these categories, we might hope to learn that he is a
basketball player and possesses a name of Welsh ancestry.
At the time of this study, Wikipedia’s roughly three million
articles were classiﬁed into exactly 293,119 categories with
610,032 edges/relationships deﬁned between them, making
this a valuable potential source of ontologies.
Our task is complicated by several factors. First, the cat-
egory names are not systematically constructed, so it is dif-
ﬁcult to identify the root category associated with a par-
ticular group. Second, membership in interesting categories
(say “basketball player”) is often not explicitly deﬁned but
implied by category inclusion. Third, the network of cat-
egories is a directed graph with cycles, not a hierarchy or
a DAG, rendering it ill-deﬁned to expand categories by in-
clusion. Finally, we note that irregularities result because
subcategories are not explicitly deﬁned by “is a” relation-
ships. For example, “Serial Killer Movies” is a sub-child of
the category “Serial Killers”, which should be semantically
restricted to people.
We employed the following procedure to build our refer-
ence lists:
•Network extraction – We used WikiPrep (available
athttp://sourceforge.net/projects/wikiprep ) to processthe raw Wikipedia ﬁle dumps. WikiPrep is a set
of scripts which extracts various content, including a
network of Wikipedia categories. Parsers and other
scripts were written to extract information in the re-
quired format.
•DAG-iﬁcation and category expansion – The category
network from Wikipedia contained directed cycles. To
break cycles, we added a root rto all source nodes
(those without incoming edges) and performed a topo-
logical sort from r, deleting any back edges encoun-
tered. Only 756 back edges were identiﬁed, essentially
all of which corresponded to non-“is a” relationships.
With the graph now a DAG, we perform a DFS/BFS
from any target category node to identify all child cat-
egories. The leaf nodes under these categories corre-
sponded to Wikipedia article titles. The set of leaf
nodes under the target categories were collected under
the target category label.
•Relevant Category Identiﬁcation – The next task was
formulating a small list of broad categories to cover
most interesting entities. Here we exploit our roster of
categorized named entities extracted by Lydia from an
extensive corpus of news documents.
To select interesting categories, we used heuristic cri-
teria such as the number of articles or named Lydia
entities below each category, the number of words in
the category title, and elimination of mechanical sub-
classes of categories reﬁned by date or place (e.g. ‘1974
Births’ and ‘British Columbia sportspeople’). We also
used external ontologies such as the most popular cat-
egories on Wikipedia, and Yahoo/Google’s web direc-
tories to reﬁne our lists. All these measures, and some
manual editing, were used to create a hierarchically
organized category set.
•Entity Prunning – Expanding groups across edges
which do not correspond to “is a” relationships lead to
inconsistencies, as in the “Serial killers” example give
above. By using entity-type data derived from Lydia
analysis of news text, we could identify and automat-
ically eliminate edges which linked groups containing
entities of diﬀerent types (e.g. Person vs. Title), thus
keeping the expanded groups relatively homogeneous.
•Post Processing - Wikipedia names are by no means
perfectly characterized for our task. Consider the case
of a cricket player of Indian origin who resides in Eng-
land. We would interpret Wikipedia as classifying this
name as being of English origin. Similar problems are
discussed in [8]. Thus, a certain amount of the inac-
curacy of our classiﬁer should be attributed to such
mislabeled data. To reduce this problem we manu-
ally cleaned some of the data-sets, reviewing certain
ethnicities and removing any obvious misassignments.
Representative of these problems were the prevalence
of Muslim names within the Jewish name roster, be-
cause of the signiﬁcant Arab population in Israel.

categories.

4. ALGORITHMIC METHODS
Our classiﬁer consists of two major components: (1) a set
of non-deterministic automata which map name strings to
ethnic categorizations, and (2) a decision tree reﬂecting the
historical/linguistic origins and coarse groupings of each eth-
nic group (see Figure 1). Starting at the root, the automaton
is applied at intermediate nodes in the tree to decide which
child to branch to. The identity of the leaf node on this root-
to-leaf path through the decision tree deﬁnes the classiﬁed
ethnicity of the given name.
Figure 1: Hierarchical categorization of CEL groups.
We classify names at each level of the tree, resolving
identity at the leaves.
4.1 Hidden Markov Model
Our classiﬁcation engine consists of a series of sub-classiﬁers
operating at each level of the CEL group hierarchy. Each
classiﬁer is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) automaton,
with states corresponding to the position within a name, and
observations corresponding to substrings from the name. Wedivide each full name into three parts: ﬁrst-name, middle-
name and last-name. When only two words exists in the full
name, we consider only the ﬁrst-name and last-name. When
only one word exists, we declare it to be the last name.
For a classiﬁer discriminating between eethnicities, the
states of the classiﬁer constitute a directed acyclic graph
with esubgraphs, each corresponding to a single ethnicity.
Each of these paths has edges with observations consisting
of strings of letters determined by the strings’ relative fre-
quency within the training data for that ethnic group.
Observations along edges consist both of full name-parts
(e.g.,“John”) and substrings thereof (e.g.,“Jo”or“hn”). The
set of these observations, as well as the transition probabil-
ities along these edges, determine the likelihood of a partic-
ular name being generated by the portion of the automa-
ton corresponding to each ethnicity. Transition probabili-
ties along multiple possible paths were manually determined,
and biased towards paths which consume larger numbers of
letters. That is, the system will prefer paths which corre-
spond to names which appear in the input data over those
which it assembles from preﬁxes and suﬃxes, all other things
being equal. Figure 2 shows diagrammatically the construc-
tion of an individual automaton.
The dark-gray states in Figure 2 correspond to matching a
name-part which occurs in the training data set. The set of
observations and observation probabilities on the transitions
to this state are made up of full name-parts and their associ-
ated frequency within this ethnicity in the training dataset.
The initial white state corresponds to the case in which the
full name-part does not occur within this ethnicity in the
training dataset. The transition probabilities to these two
states are biased such that there is a large preference for
paths which consume full names.
The remaining states correspond to matching k-mer com-
ponents ( klength substrings) of the name-part. Here, en-
tering each light-gray state corresponds to matching an in-
dividual k-mer, while entering each white state corresponds
to a failure to match a k-mer. Observations and observa-
tion probabilities on each light-gray state correspond to the
relative frequency of each k-mer within the training data
for the ethnicity. Observation probabilities on each white
state are evenly split among all possible k-mer observations.
Transition probabilities were chosen to bias heavily towards
52Figure 2: Top-level automaton of the ethnicity clas-
siﬁer. Its three stages match the ﬁrst-name, middle-
name and last-name respectively for the Asian ,
Greater African andGreater European CEL groups.
matching each k-mer through a light-gray state, if possi-
ble, and thusly penalize the use of the non-matching white
states.
The observation probability f(N)Efor the full name-part
Nmatch (dark-gray state) in ethnicity Eis calculated as:
B=f(N)E/(X
E/primef(N)E/prime) (1)
The observation probability for the k-mer match s(light-
gray state) in ethnicity Eis calculated similarly. The prob-
ability distribution on each of these k-mers is determined
not only by the distribution of k-mers in the ethnic names,
but also on the k-mers’ positions within these names. That
is, the appearance of certain k-mers are strongly biased to-
wards the beginning or end of names, and this is reﬂected
in the observation probabilities of the k-mer match states.
The automaton is also constructed to allow a path which
“blends” ethnicities. That is, the given name and the sur-
name of a name may indicate two separate ethnicities. The
automaton allows this by allowing a path to move between
ethnicities between ﬁrst/middle/last name boundaries, at
some cost. Parameter settings allow us to vary the relative
signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst, middle, and last names in the ﬁ-
nal analysis. A particular name is assigned the label of the
ethnic group associated with the ﬁnal state with the largest
probability.

family and given names. The preﬁx “Mac” suggests Scottish
or Irish ancestry (British CEL group, in our categorization)
far more strongly than the 3-mer in general. Moreover, as
our system uses 2-mers in its optimized conﬁguration, this
could be missed entirely.
To exploit this valuable cue, we compute preﬁx/suﬃx
probabilities independently from other k-mers to deﬁne the
appropriate transitions in the classiﬁer. In particular, we
sought a set of preﬁxes and suﬃxes providing some certainty
that the names belong to a particular ethnicity. Table 3
lists some of the most signiﬁcant preﬁxes/suﬃxes we iden-
tiﬁed in this search. We experimented with preﬁx/suﬃx
lengths ranging from three to ﬁve, and identiﬁed the fre-
quency f(p)Eas the number occurrences of preﬁx/suﬃx p
within distinct names of the given ethnicity E. The signiﬁ-
cance score Sof this frequency is analogous to the observa-
tion probabilities on states as given in Equation 1.
4.2 Decision Tree
We broadly follow the basic CEL groups identiﬁed by [17],
though we depart in several minor ways so as to allow for
a more natural hierarchical categorization of these groups.
The reason is three-fold. First, this hierarchical categoriza-
tion allowed us to analyze the accuracy of our classiﬁcation
engine at multiple levels of granularity as well as identify
name groups which were mutually indistinct. Second, ef-
ﬁciency issues arise in dealing with classiﬁcation over our
20 million name news corpus which favor batch processing
of smaller sets of groups. Finally, we must compensate for
the sparsity of data about certain groups. The hierarchical
classiﬁcation provides us with reasonable aggregation levels
for this purpose, allowing us to vary the trade-oﬀ between
granularity and accuracy in our analysis.
Figure 1 shows our hierarchical categorization of CEL
groups. Among the changes with respect to the Cultural
Ethnic and Linguistic (CEL) groups of [17], we have col-
lapsed Spanish andPortuguese together to form a Hispanic
group. We replaced the English group with a broader British
group including Celtic ,English andAfrican American . Fi-
nally, we have placed the Jewish group within the broad
group European .
5. PERFORMANCE RESULTS
To assess the accuracy of our classiﬁcation engine, we
constructed automatons for each level of classiﬁcation us-
53ing training sets comprising 70%of the data extracted from
Wikipedia and tested against the remaining 30%. Figure 3
shows the precision, recall, and F-scores for each ethnicity
as computed by the hierarchical classiﬁer.
In general, the accuracy at the coarsest level of granularity
is quite good, while at the ﬁnest it is comparable to other
published ethnic classiﬁcation systems. For example, the
performance of our system in classifying Hispanic names is
roughly equivalent to the accuracy of GUESS (as assessed
by Stewart et al. [21]). The most signiﬁcant practical failing
of the classiﬁer is in the classiﬁcation of Jews. The classiﬁer
here has quite low accuracy, and is heavily confused with
the British CEL group, resulting in the Jewish group being
artiﬁcially inﬂated. Table 5 gives the total entity counts and
breakdown by total names and total entity references of each
ethnicity as determined by our classiﬁer on our U.S. daily
newspaper corpus.
We ﬁnd that we did particularly well in ethnic groups like
British ,Japanese ,IndianSubContinent ,EastAsian (Chinese ,
Korean ). This is because these names are fairly distinct and
our classiﬁer identiﬁes this diﬀerence. In cases such as Jew-
ishorAfricans , our classiﬁer is not quite as good, because of
forces of history and colonization blur the interpretation of
name as a surrogate for ethnicity. Additionally, small train-
ing sets from the wikipedia data for the groups, such as the
German andJewish groups, also worsened performance for
these groups.

all the CEL groups in the hierarchy, with ethnicities
sorted by F-score.
5.1 Experimental Variations
To optimize the performance of our classiﬁer, we experi-
mented with ﬁve design decisions in the construction of the
classiﬁer and evaluated their impact on precision/recall:
•Best Path vs. Sum of Paths – The CEL group can
be assigned according to the terminating state with
highest probability; in other words, the state with the
greatest weighted sum of all paths ending in it. Al-
ternatively, the CEL group can be assigned accordingto to the terminating state which has the single most
probable path. The best path method gives somewhat
better accuracy than sum of paths.
•Single-Tier vs. Hierarchical Classiﬁer – In addition to
the hierarchical classiﬁer, we also experimented with
a single-tier classiﬁer which attempts to discriminate
between all 13leaf ethnicities simultaneously. We ﬁnd
that for some ethnicities the single-tier works better,
while for others the hierarchical classiﬁer is best. The
results favor single-tier for EastAsian ,German , and
French while the tree-based classiﬁer gives better re-
sults for British ,Muslim , and Jewish . However, we
lose the facility of getting broader classiﬁcation from
internal nodes with a single-tier classiﬁer. Moreover,
with the single-tier architecture, the large number of
states slows the processing through the automata sig-
niﬁcantly.
•Equal vs. Biased-Priors – Our initial classiﬁer used
equal transition probabilities to move to each initial
state. We also experimented with transitions proba-
bilities determined by relative frequency of names in
each ethnicity. Having known estimates of population
density has proved useful for binary classiﬁers [6]. In
general, this method increased the precision of groups
where we had small training sets ( German ,Muslim ,
andAfrican ), at the expense of recall.
•Aggressive vs. Passive Curation – This experiment at-
tempted to improve a classiﬁer by using it to clean
its training data. We tested each name from the ini-
tial training data-set using the initial classiﬁer, and
then removed all the wrongly-classiﬁed names from the
training data-set. We then re-built the classiﬁer using
thiscurated data. Table 2 gives the number of names
in the original training set and in the curated training
set. This procedure proved disappointing, however,
performing poorly compared to baseline; it particu-
larly hurt the classiﬁcation of ethnicities with small
training sets.
•2-mers vs. 3-mers – The ﬁnal experiment we per-
formed concerned the diﬀerence between various val-
ues of kin the construction of our k-mers. We ﬁnd
that increasing kdecreased the overall accuracy of the
classiﬁer.
Overall, the single-tier best-path classiﬁer arguably per-
formed best. This is not, however, the ﬁnal classiﬁer used in
our news analysis. This is because, as previously mentioned,
the hierarchical classiﬁer has several practical advantages we
wished to exploit. Thus, we use the hierarchical best-path
classiﬁer for our news analysis.
6. APPLICATIONS TO NEWS STREAMS
Our work on ethnic name classiﬁcation was motivated by
our goal to develop the Lydia news/blog analysis system as
a resource for research in the social sciences. Lydia [2, 3, 9,
14, 13, 15, 18] employs natural language processing (NLP)
and statistical analysis to reduce text streams to time series
data on the news volume and sentiment associated with each
news entity. See www.textmap.org for a representation of our
analysis.

Ward, et.al. [23] have used our classiﬁer in the course of
a signiﬁcant study on diﬀerences in news coverage between
cultural groups. We present a small portion of their data
here to provide the ﬂavor of this analysis and illustrate the
signiﬁcance and utility of our name classiﬁer. Table 5 cap-
tures the scale of this study showing the classiﬁcations of
over 20 million distinct names, comprising over 100 million

Table 5: Distribution of entities by classiﬁed ethnic-
ity as % of distinct person entities and % of news
coverage
Each name was subjected to ethnic classiﬁcation us-
ing the program described in this paper, and the refer-
ence/sentiment counts aggregated over all entities withineach CEL group. Figure 4 presents time series showing
the relative frequency and sentiment of CEL groups over
the past four years as represented within U.S. daily newspa-
pers. Interesting phenomena include large seasonal ﬂuctua-
tions in the number of references to Hispanics (attributable
to their representation in professional baseball) and persis-
tently lower sentiment associated with Muslims and (to a
lesser extent) Hispanics than members of the British and
French CEL groups.
By associating each news source with its point of origin
and modeling its sphere of inﬂuence, we can identify spatial
trends in reference and sentiment using the methods of [18].
Figure 5 demonstrates the uncanny agreement between our
modeling of the frequency of Hispanic names (as identiﬁed
using our classiﬁer) in newspapers and U.S. Census data
on the distribution of Hispanics within the United States.
Results like these conﬁrm both the general accuracy of our
name classiﬁer and its utility for social science research.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have presented a methodology for name-based eth-
nicity classiﬁcation from open sources, with experimental
results governing performance. In general, we are pleased
with our results, as our classiﬁer performs fairly well except
for some ethnicities where the training data is limited or
ambiguous.
One direction for further work involves improving the pre-
cision of our classiﬁer as well resolving ﬁner distinctions be-
tween ethnic groups (e.g. distinguishing between Russian
and other Eastern European groups). The key issue is ob-
taining a more precise and comprehensive training data-set.
One approach we have been evaluating is using person/place
collocations in our extensive news corpus to name each name
to nationality, thus generating a signiﬁcantly larger (albeit
noisier) training set.
Our other main focus is in applying our classiﬁer more
extensively to news data to analyze historical trends in in-

ternational relations, intergroup relations, and racial/ethnic
discrimination. We anticipate that this analysis will be of
great interest to a wide class of social scientists.
