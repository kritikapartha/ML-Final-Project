ABSTRACT    
In this talk, we discuss properties of public key encryption schemes which are derived 
from group signatures. Abdalla andWarinschi (ICICS 2004) and Ohtake et al. (AFRICACRYPT 2009) already showed that it is possible to construct a chosen ciphertext secure public key encryption from an arbitrary group signature scheme in a black-box manner. By extending these results, we further show that if the underlying 
group signature scheme ha s some special property, then its converted public key encryption 
scheme also yields a special property which is inherited from the underlying group  signature.
